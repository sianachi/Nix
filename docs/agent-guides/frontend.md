# Frontend guide

Read for `apps/web/` and `packages/` changes.

Keep dependency direction `apps/* -> packages/*`. Inside web: `lib/` and `a11y/`
are leaves; `layout/` may additionally reach `lib/`; features may import leaves,
siblings, and `shell/` types only; only `app.tsx` value-imports `shell/`. Put a
file where its knowledge belongs: pure arguments in `lib/`, arrangement in
`layout/`, data regions in features, composition in `shell/`.

Use stateless-first state, Zod at runtime boundaries, cache-backed API client
requests with cancellation, and workspace-scoped navigation/state. Do not revive
a browser OIDC client or make authorization decisions from claims. Manual React
memoization requires an adjacent identity, profiled-cost, or library-contract
reason.

Use token-backed Tailwind utilities/CVA, semantic colour roles, `Text` for text
variants, and the existing design grammar. No general CSS, raw design values,
`dark:` escape hatches, or emojis. UI data states must honestly show loading,
empty, error, and partial results.

Place web tests under `apps/web/src/tests/`, mirroring source folders; query by
role. UI components need stories and axe coverage. Run the path-selected
package checks and applicable frontend guards.
