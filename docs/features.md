# Nix features

The full list of what Nix does today, moved out of the README. Behaviour is defined by the source; this is a map.


## Notes, structure and editing

- Rich notes with headings, lists, tasks, quotes, code, callouts, tables, images, links, columns,
  collapsible sections, colour, page breaks, embedded live note sections, drag handles and slash
  commands, and a Markdown editing mode over the same collaborative note. Optional Vim (Normal,
  Visual, Visual Line, text objects, `.` repeat, search, marks, registers, macros and `:s`) and
  Emacs (kill ring, mark ring, I-search, query replace, numeric arguments, registers and keyboard
  macros) keyboard modes.
- Notes, canvases, spreadsheets and artifacts as body kinds. Canvases use shared Excalidraw scenes;
  spreadsheets provide A1 addressing, references, ranges, formula functions, dependency tracking and
  cycle checks; artifacts hold a saved interactive component and its values.
- Durable file items with immutable versions, replace-in-place, PDF and image previews, file-backed
  editor images, and built-in viewers for EPUB, CSV, Markdown, Mermaid, media and text.
- A composable item tree with nesting, breadcrumbs, drag-to-reparent, cycle checking, a six-entry
  New menu (note, canvas, sheet, upload, structured item, from a template) that asks for a title
  and a location, delete with Undo restore, bookmarks, hidden items, moving items between
  workspaces, personal workspace groups and pins, two-pane navigation and responsive phone layouts.
- Daily notes with a per-workspace switch, Year/Month folders, a quick capture dialog and a
  "Today" app shortcut.
- CRDT editing over an append-only update log, rebuildable snapshots, WebSocket synchronisation,
  authorization handshakes, presence, live cursors and connection status.
- Version history derived from the collaboration log: revisions, the document as it stood at any
  revision, restore as a new revision, and named versions that retention never deletes.
- Password locks that withhold a subtree's titles, children, views and rollups, and item
  protections (`no_delete`, `no_children`, `managed_by`) for items an integration owns.
- `[[` and `@` references, backlinks, full-text search, a command palette and an accessible graph
  with pan, zoom, fit, neighbourhood highlight, shape by kind, filters, collapsing, a time view and
  saved views.

## Data, views and workflows

- Ancestor-cascading property schemas, validated writes and in-place editing for supported property
  types.
- Formula properties, child rollups and server-backed charts with bounded evaluation and cycle
  detection.
- List, board, calendar, gallery, timeline, spreadsheet, chart, drive, habit tracker, finance,
  checklist, matrix, outline, group chat, Quick Form, Interactive Form, Smart List and custom views,
  including composed primary and companion views; filters on every view, several sort keys and
  column summaries. Custom views run a small openui-lang program, written in a highlighted editor or
  a visual designer.
- Multi-select with a floating tray for bulk move and delete, drag-to-reparent rows, resizable
  columns, in-place value editing on cards and phone rows, and a per-view choice of how items open.
- Guided setup for structured views, with tab-persistent drafts.
- Task semantics for completion, due dates, start dates, priority, estimates and assignees;
  recurring tasks and calendar entries; Today, Next 7 days, Overdue and Assigned to me workflows; a
  My Day page with today's tasks and habits.
- Habit tracking with check-in and undo, status, streak insights and charts.
- Finance tracking: accounts, loans, budget lines and actuals, transactions, scheduled postings,
  cash flow, a dashboard, a close-month checklist and bank CSV import with preview before commit.
- Reminders as an explicit `reminder` property, due and habit reminders, a notification inbox,
  Web Push through the installed app, quiet hours, a time zone and per-container muting.
- Automations owned by the person who wrote them: schedule, date-arrives and property-changed
  triggers, up to five conditions, and notify, set-property and create-item actions, with a run
  log, a dry run and automatic disable after repeated failures.
- Two-way calendar sync with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook from a Calendars settings tab:
  external events in the calendar view, dated Nix items pushed out, last-write-wins with a log,
  and 15-minute drag and resize on entries.
- Model-free suggestions with an off switch: duplicate notices, property suggestions, similar
  items, free-slot and fill-series helpers.
- User-authored, file-backed and managed templates: capture, edit, browse, apply and create from a
  validated template tree, with initialization inputs and relative dates.
- Revocable, opaque Interactive Form links. Sanitized public forms turn responses into ordinary child
  items without exposing the workspace or existing responses.

## Companion

- A companion that runs on ChatGPT through the Codex device login, or on Claude or OpenRouter with
  the person's own API key, chosen per pet. It has account-scoped character, personality,
  response-length and instruction settings, model selection, and named, resumable conversations
  that can be searched, renamed and saved as chat notes.
- The companion reads the open note and attached files (text, CSV, JSON, PDFs and images),
  searches before answering and cites its sources. It can turn a note into views and write a
  note from views.
- Explicitly approved companion workspace tools for searching, reading, creating, appending to,
  renaming, moving, trashing, restoring and updating items, and structure tools that create
  structured containers, add views and fields, edit forms, set recurrence, and add or change custom
  views. The same chat validates and builds blueprints and saves them as templates. Every plan is
  previewed in Nix before it runs, reads and writes stay behind Core's permissions, and uncertain
  results are reported for inspection rather than claimed as complete.
- Interactive replies: the companion and chat notes can answer with live components (calculators,
  forms, tables, charts and permission-aware lists of items) and save them as artifacts. A component
  that changes the workspace waits on an approval card that can be edited before it is approved.

## Access, portability and operations

- Core-owned browser BFF authentication with OIDC, PKCE, HttpOnly sessions and short-lived Nix tokens;
  multi-issuer support; workspace-scoped roles, invitations, membership administration, tenant administrators
  managed from Settings, personal workspace provisioning and live revocation. Passwords, passkeys and second factors live at the
  identity provider.
- Nix Sites publish a subtree of a workspace as a static website at `<slug>.<sites-domain>` or a
  verified custom hostname, in a docs or blog layout with navigation, a footer, search, feeds, a
  sitemap, structured data and link previews. Interactive components are replaced by a notice.
  Images, captured Mermaid diagrams and attached PDF, text, CSV, MP4 and WebM files are published
  (videos play in a player, up to 50 MB, and are published as stored, metadata included). Locked,
  excluded, trashed and unscheduled content is withheld; a file removed from the site stops being
  served at the next publish. Where first publishes need approval, operators review them in Settings
  or with `nixctl site approvals`, and can name more approvers and tenant administrators in
  Settings. Off unless `Nix:Sites:Enabled`; see ADR-0063.
- Permission-filtered access backed by Postgres row-level security; roles live in the database, not
  in tokens.
- Personal access tokens with independent `read`, `write` and `admin` scopes and a required expiry
  of 1 to 365 days, for `nixctl`, MCP and scripts.
- Export of documents and subtrees to lossless `.nix`, PDF, DOCX and Markdown, with declared losses.
  Views, forms, sheets and canvases export as readable static content.
- Editable Markdown, TXT, DOCX and PDF imports, `.nix` archive import, and a one-time Obsidian
  vault import. PDF OCR is unavailable.
- `nixctl`, a scriptable CLI with JSON output and 34 top-level commands: health, auth, workspaces,
  items, notes, canvases, properties, schema, views, query, search, structure and blueprints,
  templates, history, recurrence, calendar and calendar sync, My Day, finance, habits,
  notifications, reminders, automations, files, export, import, document import, operations,
  chat notes, the companion, sites, MCP and stress runs.
- An MCP server started through `nixctl mcp`, on stdio for one profile or over Streamable HTTP with
  `--listen`, where every request carries its own personal access token. It acts as that principal,
  limited to their reach, with 108 tools covering items, notes and search, workspaces and members,
  templates, finance, habits, document import, files, chat notes, the companion, structure and
  blueprints, notifications, reminders, item protection, calendar links and automations. Settings
  has an MCP tab that mints and revokes its tokens.
- One Go worker binary with roles for import, export, signed WebAssembly plugin
  execution, calendar sync and notifications, driven by RabbitMQ; workers use internal
  APIs and object capabilities without database credentials.
- Uploads are inspected by the worker before they are published: size and expiry checks, SHA-256,
  media type from magic bytes, preview and thumbnail generation. Files are not malware-scanned.
- An installable web app with manifest shortcuts (New note, Today, Search), a share target, a
  Markdown file handler, an offline page, notes that can be edited offline and sync on reconnect,
  interface settings synced across devices, last-location restore, right-click context menus and a
  keyboard shortcuts dialog; light and dark themes.
- A one-line installer (`deploy/install.sh`) for Docker Compose or Kubernetes that generates
  secrets, bundles the identity provider behind Caddy with automatic HTTPS, migrates and prints the
  administrator sign-in; re-running it upgrades. CI-built multi-architecture images tagged by commit
  and release, migrations, seed and verification jobs, a smoke-tested release script, a
  restic-to-R2 backup helper, and nightly backup status for operators in Settings. Logical database
  dumps alone do not restore file-backed documents.


Each planned area has a measurable stress test. A green test suite is not treated as proof of layout,
accessibility, query plans, export fidelity or production operations until those things are observed.
