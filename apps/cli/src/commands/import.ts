/**
 * `nixctl import`: bring a Markdown file or a folder tree into a workspace.
 *
 * This is the Markdown lane of MVP-7's import (7.3/7.9), built client-side from primitives the
 * workspace already trusts - `item create`, the collab body write, the property merge - so it adds
 * no server surface and inherits the same authorization and refusals every other command has. The
 * `.nix`/DOCX/PDF lanes need the server import endpoint that phase still owes and are refused by
 * name here rather than half-handled.
 *
 * The report is the point. Every file the walk meets ends up in exactly one bucket - created,
 * skipped (with why), failed (with why), or not attempted (because its parent failed or the run
 * stopped) - and what a created item still lost (a body write or a property patch that was
 * refused) is declared on its own row, so "what was mapped and what was dropped" is answered by
 * the output rather than by re-reading the tree. Wiki links, Obsidian embeds, local/unsupported
 * image targets, and inline image flattening are measured by the body parser and declared. A
 * `--dry-run` prints the same mapping without touching the network, which is the
 * preview-before-commit 7.5 asks the host to render. Anything short of a complete import leaves
 * with a non-zero exit code, after the report has been printed.
 *
 * **It stops honestly on Core's write rate limit**, the same way `stress seed` does: a large tree
 * meets the per-IP write cap, and when it does the import keeps what it made, lists everything it
 * did not attempt, and names the override to raise - never a hang, never a silent partial dressed
 * as a whole. There is no resume: removing the partial import (`nixctl item rm <rootItemId>`) and
 * running again is the honest path, and the report says so.
 *
 * The planned tree - paths, titles, front matter, bodies - is held in memory for the run, so the
 * command is sized for trees that fit there comfortably; the streaming shape a 10k-note import
 * needs is goal 7.7's, not this commit's claim.
 *
 * The web application carries a twin of this run loop (`apps/web/src/import/import-run.ts`): the
 * transports differ, but the bucket names, the stop policy, and "the root is the first thing
 * created" must stay in step between the two, so a change to any of those here owes the same
 * change there.
