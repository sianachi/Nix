/**
 * Zen mode: the open note or file fills the window and the application's chrome steps aside.
 *
 * **A leaf store, for the reason `a11y/announcer.ts` is one.** The shell decides whether to draw
 * the rail, the tree and the header; the editor page decides whether to draw the tab strip, the
 * item's action rows and its side panel; the pet launcher decides whether to draw at all. All of
 * them have to read one answer, and the page may not import the shell, so the answer lives where
 * both can reach it. One boolean with no selectors does not need a Zustand slice.
 *
 * **Remembered for the browser tab only.** A reload keeps somebody inside the note they were
 * reading; a new session starts with the application as they would expect to find it.
 *
 * **Two facts, not one.** `zenModeOn` is what the reader asked for and is kept across screens.
 * Whether it *does* anything is `useZenActive`: it needs an item on screen, claimed by the page
 * that draws one with `claimZenSurface`. On the calendar or in settings the preference is kept
 * and nothing is hidden, so arriving back at a note finds Zen exactly as it was left.
