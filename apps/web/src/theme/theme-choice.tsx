/**
 * Choosing the ground: follow the machine, or pick one.
 *
 * **Three options rather than a two-state switch.** Following the machine is a real choice, not
 * the absence of one - somebody whose desktop turns dark at dusk wants this to turn with it. A
 * toggle cannot say that: it can only record whichever ground they were on when they last touched
 * it, and then stop following.
 *
 * Rendered as a radio group rather than three buttons, because that is what it is: one choice from
 * a fixed set, exactly one of which is current. A screen reader announces the set, the current
 * member and its position, and arrow keys move between them - none of which three buttons would
 * give without being told to imitate a radio group.
