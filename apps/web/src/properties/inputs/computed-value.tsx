/**
 * A computed value: the result of a formula, not a field.
 *
 * **An `<output>` rather than a read-only `<input>`, and that is three fixes in one element.** It is
 * a labelable element, so the panel's label still points at it; it is not in the tab order, so a
 * column of three thousand computed cells does not put three thousand dead stops in the keyboard
 * path; and it carries an implicit live region, so a value that changes because somebody edited a
 * different property is announced rather than silently updated. That last one is asserted from the
 * element's semantics rather than proved - settling it needs a real screen reader, which this
 * environment does not have.
 *
 * **An error is shown as an error, with the sentence that says what to do about it.** The value a
 * formula produces can be one of the sheet's error codes, and a bare `#NAME?` in a field called
 * Total reads as a value rather than as a fault to somebody who has never used a spreadsheet. The
 * codes are explained by `PROPERTY_FORMULA_HELP`, which is this surface's own map: three of the
 * grid's sentences are false here, because there is no grid.
 *
 * **The explanation belongs to the panel, not to the table.** A panel shows one value at a time and
 * has room for a sentence; a column repeats whatever it is given once per row, so the expression
 * and the help would print under every cell and grow every row to say what the column header could
 * say once. In a table the code itself is the value, which is what a spreadsheet shows too.
