/**
 * The picture property's control: a picker, not a text field.
 *
 * **Still an address underneath, by design.** There is no file or media model in this build, so
 * "choose a picture" means "hand over an address a browser may fetch" - typed, pasted, or read off
 * a dragged image or link. What changed from the plain url field is what is *shown*: the thing the
 * address is for. A property whose whole point is a picture, edited as a line of text, made
 * somebody open the gallery to find out whether the line they typed was the picture they meant.
 *
 * **Four states, told apart in words, mirroring the gallery card's ladder** (`CoverPane`): nothing
 * set - an address box and the sentence saying a link can be pasted or dragged in; a value
 * that is not a fetchable address - the box, prefilled, with the reason beside it, never handed to
 * an `img` (a schema retype does not revalidate stored values, so yesterday's text can be today's
 * picture property); set - the thumbnail through `<Duotone>`, the address, an edit affordance and a
 * remove control; failed - the words that say the fetch broke, with the address still shown,
 * because the property is not empty and telling somebody it was would send them re-entering an
 * address that is already right.
 *
 * **The failure is the address that failed, not a flag.** Same reasoning as the gallery: a boolean
 * would need a mirrored copy of the address to know when to clear. Stored as the URL, "failed" is
 * derived - a corrected address simply is not the failed one, so the state self-heals with nothing
 * to reconcile.
 *
 * **Validation mirrors `PropertyValidator.CheckImage` for immediacy; the server stays the
 * authority.** An invalid address is refused in place, with the server's own sentence shape, and
 * nothing is written - a client that wrote it anyway would show the refusal a round-trip later
 * against a field that has already moved on.
 *
 * **Self-contained rather than sharing `property-input.tsx`'s shells.** The shells wire a label to
 * exactly one control; the set state here is three - thumbnail, address, remove - and importing
 * them back would make the two files a cycle. The dependency stays one-way: the dispatch imports
 * this component, and this component imports only the props type, which compiles away.
