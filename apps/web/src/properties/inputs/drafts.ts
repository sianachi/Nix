 * A multi-select's draft: every box checked so far, kept apart from what the item last reported.
 *
 * **The bug this replaces.** Each checkbox used to build its next list from the item's own value -
 * "as last saved" - rather than from what was on screen. Two taps close together both read that
 * same stale value before either write returned, so the second tap's request carried only its own
 * box and silently dropped the first. Keeping the selection here, updated the instant a box is
 * tapped, means the second tap builds on the first's choice rather than on the server's last
 * answer - the same fix `useDraft` above makes for typed fields, for the same shape of race.
 *
 * **Sends one write per tap rather than debouncing**, each carrying the whole selection as it
 * stands at that moment. However the two responses land, the last request sent is the one with
 * every choice, so the item ends up holding what is on screen rather than whichever tap's request
 * happened to answer last.
