/**
 * The options this person picked most often in a choice control, offered again ahead of the
 * declared list, and the call that remembers a pick.
 *
 * **The declared order is never changed.** A schema's option order is somebody's decision - a
 * status runs Backlog, Doing, Done for a reason - and a list that reorders itself breaks the
 * muscle memory of everyone who learned it. So the full list stays as declared and the top
 * {@link RECENT_CHOICES} picks are repeated in a leading "Recent" group, which is the familiar
 * shape of a font or language picker.
 *
 * **Scoped to the workspace and the property key** (`select:<workspace>:<key>`): a select's values
 * are workspace data, so one workspace's habits never surface in another's, and "Status" in one
 * container shares its history with "Status" in the next because a key reused across containers
 * is, nearly always, the same vocabulary. The values stored are option labels - workspace content
 * a person typed into a schema - which is why the store is cleared whenever the subject changes
 * (see `lib/frecency.ts`).
 *
 * **Read once, when the control mounts.** The scores are a snapshot rather than a subscription:
 * a Recent group that changed the moment somebody chose from it would move the value they just
 * picked out from under the pointer. The next control to mount sees the pick. A workspace switch
 * re-reads, because the snapshot is keyed by its namespace.
 *
 * **Off, or outside a workspace, there is no memory.** The "Order choices by what I pick most"
 * preference turns off both the group and the recording. A public form renders these controls
 * with no workspace at all, and a history keyed to nobody's workspace would leak one visitor's
 * picks into the next visitor's form on a shared machine.
