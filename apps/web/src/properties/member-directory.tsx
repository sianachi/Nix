 * page through the member list two hundred times. So a view that shows people mounts one directory
 * above its cards, and every value display reads names out of it.
 *
 * **Absent is not an error, and neither is it an answer.** Outside a directory - a story, a
 * component test, a view whose schema declares no assignee - nothing has been asked, so nothing
 * may be said to be unknown. Only a directory whose read succeeded can say an identifier is not a
 * member; while it is loading, or after it failed, the display says less rather than something
 * false.
