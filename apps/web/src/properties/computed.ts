/**
 * Computed properties: the values an item has without ever having stored one.
 *
 * **Evaluated on read, and merged into the bag every other reader already uses.** A formula
 * property's value is produced here, from the values the item is carrying at this moment, and put
 * into `properties` under its own key before any view sees the item. That is what lets a list cell,
 * a board column, a sort, a gallery card and the property panel show a computed value without one
 * of them learning what a formula is - they read a property bag, as they always did.
 *
 * **Nothing computed is ever written back.** The write paths send only the keys somebody edited, and
 * Core refuses a value for a computed property outright, so a merged bag cannot leak back into
 * storage. The merge is a read-side decoration and the item in state stays exactly as the server
 * sent it.
 *
 * **The engine is `@nix/sheet` and there is only one of it.** The same tokenizer, parser, operators,
 * coercions and functions run here as run in a spreadsheet body, which is why a formula reads the
 * same way in both places. This module's whole job is the two conversions the engine cannot make
 * for itself: a JSON property value into the engine's value domain, and a computed value back into
 * something a property bag can carry.

 * property nobody has filled in yet is empty, not unknown, and is read as null.
