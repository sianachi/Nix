 * writes the one property that view groups by. A note with a status and an owner had no way to
 * carry either from the note itself; this is that way.
 *
 * **The panel writes one property per request, and only the one that changed.** The contract merges
 * - a member set to null clears that property, anything unmentioned is left alone - so there is no
 * reason to send the whole bag back and every reason not to: sending properties nobody touched
 * would make one person's edit overwrite another's, and would turn a value this build could not
 * render into a value this build deleted.
 *
 * **Which properties appear is not this component's decision.** They come from the folder the item
 * is in and from the folders above it, which is exactly what the empty state has to say - otherwise
 * "no properties" reads as a fault rather than as a folder that has not declared any.
