/**
 * The workspace tree's off-canvas drawer, in isolation from the shell that mounts and unmounts it.
 *
 * `app-shell.tsx` decides *when* this is on screen and what focus does around each of the three
 * ways out - `sidebar.test.tsx` covers that decision, including the `inert` pane content and the
 * regression between this drawer's Escape and `workspace-sidebar.tsx`'s own "New" menu. What
 * belongs here is only what this component itself guarantees: a scrim that dismisses on tap and
 * is not a tab stop, and an Escape that asks the caller to close. There is no focus management
 * left to test - see the module's own doc comment for why a trap was never reintroduced.
