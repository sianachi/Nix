/**
 * Whether the workspace tree is on screen.
 *
 * **Remembered, not held for the session - on a wide screen.** Somebody who collapses the fixed
 * panel has decided they want the width back, and reopening the application to find it open again
 * would make the control feel like it did not work. It is stored the same way the theme is, and
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * **Not in the URL**, unlike the selected item or the active view. Those describe *what* is being
 * looked at and belong in a link somebody can share; this describes how one person's window is
 * arranged, and sending it to a colleague would collapse their sidebar for them.
 *
 * **Transient, and narrow-scoped, on a phone.** Below the breakpoint the tree is an off-canvas
 * drawer rather than the fixed panel (`app-shell.tsx`, `sidebar-drawer.tsx`), and dismissing a
 * drawer is not the same choice as collapsing a panel - it is "I'm done looking at this, for now",
 * not "give the width back to the document". Persisting it the same way the wide preference is
 * would mean closing the drawer on a phone silently left a later, wider visit to the same
 * application collapsed, which is a different screen's decision leaking into this one's storage.
 * So the narrow arrangement gets its own piece of state that never touches `localStorage`, and it
 * starts closed on every fresh render regardless of what the wide preference says - a shared link
 * opened on a phone must show the document it named, not a drawer covering it.
