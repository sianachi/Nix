 * "Mute reminders" on an item's menu: adds the item to the caller's muted containers (ADR-0051
 * section 3), which silences reminders from it and everything inside it. Settings > Notifications
 * lists what is muted and is where to find it again.
 *
 * **The label reads the cached preferences; the write reads fresh ones.** A menu is built when it
 * opens and must not wait on the network, so the label uses whatever preferences document is
 * already cached. The write then reads the current document and saves at its revision, so a menu
 * built from a stale cache still cannot overwrite a change made on another device.
