/**
 * What stands where a locked body, or a locked item's views, would be.
 *
 * **It says whose password opens it.** A lock covers everything under the locked item, so a note
 * inside a locked folder is opened with the folder's password. The prompt names the folder then,
 * rather than asking for a password the note never had.
 *
 * **It says what a lock is and is not.** A lock hides the text from anybody without the password;
 * it is not encryption. Somebody deciding what to put behind one deserves to know that, and the
 * place they meet the lock is where they will read it.
 *
 * **When it replaces a body that was open, it says why and takes focus.** A body that closes under
 * somebody - because their fifteen minutes ran out, or because they locked it again - would
 * otherwise leave focus on nothing and a prompt indistinguishable from a first visit. On a first
 * visit it leaves focus alone: arriving at a note is not a reason to pull the caret into a form.
 *
 * The password field is labelled and the refusal is announced through the field's error, so a
 * wrong password is heard as well as seen, and focus goes back to the field for another try.
