/**
 * An item's lock, as this browser session sees it, and the actions on it.
 *
 * **Core decides; this reports.** Whether the body is served is answered by Core on every read, so
 * nothing here unlocks anything by itself. What this hook adds is the moment the grant runs out:
 * it closes the body when `unlockedUntil` passes, says so a minute before, and says afterwards why
 * the body closed - rather than waiting for the collaboration service to refuse its next re-check.
 *
 * **Every state is separate**, like the backlinks panel: loading is not "unlocked", and a failed
 * read is not "not locked". Treating either as open would draw an editor that then fails to
 * connect, which reads as the note having gone missing.
 *
 * **A lock covers its subtree.** An item inside a locked item is locked by it, and so are its
 * children and views. `lockItemId` names the item whose password opens this one - the item itself,
 * or an ancestor - and unlocking or locking again acts on that item, so a note inside a locked
 * folder is opened with the folder's password and closes with the folder.
 *
 * **A change that does not close the body keeps it on screen.** Setting, changing or removing a
 * lock re-reads the state behind the last answer rather than dropping to "loading", so the editor,
 * the toolbar button and the dialog it opened stay mounted and keep their focus. Only closing - a
 * relock or an expiry - clears the answer, because then the body must go at once.
