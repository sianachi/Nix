/**
 * One workspace, drawn.
 *
 * **There are two representations and both are complete.** The `<svg>` is the picture, and it is
 * `aria-hidden`: a scatter of discs and paths conveys nothing through an accessibility tree, and
 * labelling it `role="img"` with a summary would be claiming otherwise. Beside it is a real tree of
 * buttons carrying the same nodes, the same nesting and - the part a drawing genuinely cannot
 * offer - each node's outgoing references named in words.
 *
 * **That tree is `sr-only`, which is a visual decision and not an accessibility one.** On screen it
 * would be a second copy of the workspace stacked under a picture of the workspace, which is
 * clutter; to a screen reader it is the only form of the graph that can be read at all. Hiding it
 * visually costs sighted readers nothing and removing it would cost everyone else the whole view.
 *
 * **The discs are clickable and draggable; they are not focusable.** Pointer affordances inside an
 * `aria-hidden` subtree are fine - a mouse reaches them and assistive technology is not told they
 * exist, which is honest, because the same actions are on the real buttons in the tree. A
 * `tabIndex` here would not be: a focusable control inside `aria-hidden` is a tab stop that
 * announces nothing, which is worse than either having it or not.
 *
 * **A tap is not a click.** A mouse click and a touch tap land on the same pointer events, but a
 * touch reader never hovered - the label a mouse user sees before committing to open something
 * never showed up for them, so the same gesture that opens a note for one reader is a blind tap for
 * the other. On a coarse pointer the first tap on a node only selects it, writing its name and
 * offering an "Open <title>" button in its place; a second tap on that same node, or the button
 * itself, opens it. A mouse - `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)')` says no - keeps the one-tap-opens
 * behaviour it always had.
 */

/**
 * When a node writes its name.
 *
 * Labels used to be permanent, and past a few dozen items that is a grey mat of overlapping text
 * rather than a graph - the shape, which is the thing a drawing is for, disappears underneath the
 * words. So a node is a disc until you ask: hover, keyboard focus, tapped-and-selected on a coarse
 * pointer, or being the item that is currently open.
 *
 * Hover is CSS rather than React state on purpose. `group-hover` costs no re-render, and a graph
 * at the 2,000-node ceiling re-rendering every disc on every `mousemove` would be janky for a
 * cosmetic change. Focus and touch selection are React state because both change on a discrete
