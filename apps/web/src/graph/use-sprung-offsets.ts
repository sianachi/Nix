 * Offsets that travel to where they are told to be, rather than appearing there.
 *
 * `target` is where each nudged node belongs; what comes back is where each is right now. A node
 * that leaves `target` springs home and is then forgotten, so "Tidy up" is an animation and not a
 * jump. The node under the pointer is `pinned`: it must sit exactly under the hand, and a spring
 * between a finger and the thing it is holding reads as lag.
 *
 * With reduced motion asked for, the target is handed straight back and no frame is ever requested.
