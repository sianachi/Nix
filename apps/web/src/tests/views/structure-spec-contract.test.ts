/**
 * The compile-time tie between `@nix/structure-spec`'s structural types and this app's own,
 * Zod-parsed ones.
 *
 * `@nix/structure-spec` may depend only on `zod` and `@nix/sheet` (task 0.3 of
 * `docs/plans/pet-structure-consult-plan.md`; see
 * `docs/adr/0050-companion-structure-tools-compile-declarative-specs.md`), so it cannot import
 * `container-model.ts`'s types directly - they are tied to `@nix/api-client`'s generated
 * contract. Instead it declares its own `StructureProperty`, `StructureView` and their form and
 * filter parts, shaped by hand to match.
 *
 * Each pair below is assigned both ways, which proves mutual assignability: every field one side
 * declares exists, compatibly typed, on the other. That is a real guard - a renamed or narrowed
 * field on either side fails `pnpm --filter @nix/web typecheck` here rather than surfacing later
 * as a silent shape mismatch - but it is not exact type equality: a field added as *optional* to
 * one side only would still assign both ways and would not be caught here. `StructureSchema` is
 * narrower on purpose (it omits `EffectiveSchema`'s `declared`), so it ties to a `Pick` of the web
 * type instead of the whole of it.
