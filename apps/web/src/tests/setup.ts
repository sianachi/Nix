/**
 * jsdom implements `<dialog>` as far as its `open` attribute and stops: `showModal` and `close` do
 * not exist there. Anything in this application that opens a modal - the schema editor, the view
 * editor - would throw on render without them. The shim supplies exactly those two methods, which
 * lets a test exercise what a component does with a dialog without pretending to have tested the
 * top layer, the backdrop or the focus trap; those belong to the library's own stories, which run
 * in a real browser.
 *
 * Guarded, because this file is the whole app's setup and not every suite wants a DOM: a test that
 * declares `@vitest-environment node` - compiling a stylesheet, say - has no HTMLDialogElement to
 * patch and would otherwise fail here before running a line of its own.

/**
 * A media query, which jsdom does not implement at all.
 *
 * Not a convenience. Without it, every render that asks whether the window can hold a second pane
 * throws - and the failure surfaces as an unrelated element missing from the page, which is a long
 * way from anything about media queries. Wide by default, so the suite exercises the arrangement
 * the address actually asks for; a test about narrow behaviour stubs this itself, with the same
 * `stubViewport` this establishes the default through - see that module's own comment for why this
 * call, here, is the one exception to "a test stubs its own width".

/**
 * Not Testing Library's 1000ms default, and it is the tighter of the two
 * deadlines a slow test can hit here - the other is `testTimeout` in
 * vite.config.ts, which says why it is not 5000 either.
 *
 * Every `findBy*` and `waitFor` running on real timers gives up after this
 * long. A page render that takes ~200ms alone was measured taking well over a
 * second when the full suite runs with the machine's cores saturated, and the
 * failure it produces - "Unable to find role ..." with a DOM dump - reads
 * exactly like the element genuinely never appeared. That is the expensive kind
 * of flake: nothing about it says "this was only slow".
 *
 * 5s absorbs that contention, and sits deliberately below `testTimeout` so a
 * query that really will never resolve still fails as Testing Library's
 * diagnostic rather than as a bare Vitest timeout with no DOM to look at.
 *
 * The caveat, for whoever hits it first: this is wall-clock time only while the
 * timers are real. `@testing-library/dom`'s `waitFor` arms its deadline with
 * `setTimeout(..., timeout)` before it checks whether timers are faked, so
 * under a bare `vi.useFakeTimers()` the 5000 becomes 5000 *fake* ms advanced 50
 * at a time - a longer failure path, not a longer grace period. Every
 * fake-timer suite here passes `{ shouldAdvanceTime: true }`, which walks the
 * fake clock at roughly wall-clock pace and keeps the two readings close;
 * timeline-view.test.tsx is the one file that combines fake timers with a
 * `findAllBy*` and it relies on exactly that. A suite that ever freezes the
 * clock outright should pass its own `timeout` to the query rather than lean on
 * this number.
