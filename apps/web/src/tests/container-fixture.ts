 * rather than silently leaving them stale. The bad half was that adding a member meant editing all
 * five, and every one of them spelled the defaults slightly differently.
 *
 * Kept as a factory rather than a shared constant because a test that mutates a shared object
 * fails a different test, in a different file, in an order-dependent way.
