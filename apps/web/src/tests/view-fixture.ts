/**
 * A view, with only the fields a test cares about spelled out.
 *
 * **One of these rather than nine.** Every test file under `tests/views/` used to carry its own
 * complete `View` literal - the same thirteen fields, the same nulls - so a field added to the
 * record was thirteen edits in ten files, none of which any test was about. ADR-0020 accepts that
 * threading cost for the flat view record on the product side, where each site is a real decision;
 * it is not a reason for the fixtures to restate the shape ten times.
 *
 * The defaults are the least interesting view there is: a list, configured with nothing, named
 * once. A test that cares about a field says so and the rest stay out of the way - which is also
 * what makes a fixture readable, since what a test overrides is exactly what it is about.
 *
 * Files with their own house defaults - a board grouped by status, a calendar placed by a date -
 * keep a local `viewOf` that calls this with them, so a caller's overrides still win.
