/**
 * The shell's scroll model, as a structural contract.
 *
 * **What these cannot do.** jsdom performs no layout: every element is zero by
 * zero, nothing overflows anything, and no scrollbar exists to count. So none
 * of this proves the page does not scroll sideways. That is checked by opening
 * the app at 1280x720 on a container wide enough to overflow and confirming
 * `document.documentElement.scrollWidth === clientWidth` while the sidebar
 * stays put.
 *
 * **What they do.** The model is a few structural claims - one height owner,
 * panes that clip, one scroller per pane on one axis - and each is checkable.
 * They are anchored on landmarks found by role and then read off the class
 * contract, because a class list is where this particular design lives.
 *
 * **Every test here mounts a container view on purpose.** The pane scroller
 * only exists on that branch: at `/` with no item selected the editor renders a
 * one-line placeholder and there is no scroller in the tree at all, so an
 * assertion about it passes against the code this goal replaced just as well as
 * against the fix. An earlier draft of this file did exactly that and certified
 * nothing.
