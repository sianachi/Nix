 * from the store rather than from a prop, so a row and the open document cannot disagree about the
 * same item - which they would the moment one of them was keeping its own copy.
 *
 * **It is a toggle, and it says which state it is in.** `aria-pressed` rather than swapping the
 * accessible name between "Bookmark" and "Remove bookmark": a toggle button is a thing with a
 * state, and a screen reader announces that state itself. Two names for one control would make the
 * same key press sound like it did two different things.
