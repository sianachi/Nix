 * it always runs while open, and while closed it keeps running only for as long as the last
 * known state is `thinking` or a tool is `pending` - never against an idle, closed panel.
 *
 * The request id behind `send` stays fixed until either a send succeeds or the caller calls

 * unedited draft reaches the worker as the same request, while a retry of an edited draft is a
 * new one.

 * conversation. Every time the runtime effect below restarts it clears the exposed `runtime` to
 * `null` immediately (rather than leaving the old snapshot on screen until the next watch
 * response), and bumps `generation` - a response that started under an earlier generation
 * (a watch tick, a command, or a tool `onChange` from `PetWorkTools`) is dropped rather than
 * applied once it arrives late, whichever of those three sources it came from.
