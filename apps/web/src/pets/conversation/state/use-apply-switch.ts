/** Lane F: run clean changes without a click, for this conversation. Plain React state on
 * purpose - never sent to the worker - starting from the pet's saved default, so closing the
 * panel or reloading comes back to that default rather than to whatever was last pressed. The
 * stored scope makes a switch to another pet or workspace read as the new pet's default without
 * an effect: the choice belonged to the conversation it was made in. Writes already waiting when
 * the switch goes on stay the owner's to decide: the switch only covers what arrives after it.
 * The same holds when the panel (re)mounts: a write already waiting when the conversation first
 * loads is never auto-applied, so one left waiting with the switch off cannot run on reopening.
 * A note-scoped conversation offers the same switch; the note scope still bounds what it may
 * touch (packages/companion scope rules), and a read-only note offers no writes at all. */
