 * afresh on each call, including after a lock or membership change; a device cache must never
 * substitute for that decision. Only once Core has answered, and named the object, are bytes this
 * tab already downloaded for that same object reused instead of fetched again - which is what
 * makes a revisited folder one round trip per picture rather than two.
 *
 * Rejects with Core's own error when it refuses (a 404 covers no thumbnail, unreadable and locked
 * alike), and with a plain error when the capability or the download is not usable.
