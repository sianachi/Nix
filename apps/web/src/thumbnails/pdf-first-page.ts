 * A PDF's first page as a JPEG, drawn in this tab.
 *
 * It is drawn here and not on the server because a PDF is a program-shaped file from a stranger -
 * fonts, filters, embedded images, scripts - and the owner does not want a native renderer parsing
 * those on Core's side of the line. In the browser the parser runs in a worker with no access to
 * the page, under the page's own Content-Security-Policy, and a hostile file costs one tab a
 * thumbnail and nothing else.
 *
 * pdf.js and its worker are imported on first use, so none of it is in the entry bundle: a user who
 * never opens a gallery of PDFs never downloads a PDF engine. The worker is one of this app's own
 * files (`?worker`), which is what `default-src 'self'` permits; a CDN or `blob:` worker would not
 * be allowed, and the policy is not ours to loosen.
 *
 * Everything a stranger controls is bounded: bytes in, pixels out, and time.
