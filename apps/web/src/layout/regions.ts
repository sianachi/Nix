/**
 * The shell's arrangement, named once.
 *
 * ## The regions
 *
 * Left to right, and every screen in the product is some subset of these:
 *
 *   rail    | tree           | panes                      | settings panel
 *   fixed   | resizable,     | one to three, split by     | fixed width,
 *   width,  | collapsible,   | the address, each owning   | toggled per
 *   always  | a drawer below | one vertical scroller      | reader
 *           | `lg`           |                            |
 *
 * `shell/app-shell.tsx` composes them and owns the viewport: exactly one element
 * is `h-dvh`, exactly one clips, and each pane owns exactly one scroller. **The
 * vertical axis belongs to the pane, the horizontal axis to the view**, because
 * only the view knows what its wide axis is - a board scrolls through columns, a
 * table through property columns, and the pane cannot know which. See that file
 * for the full scroll model and for what went wrong before it existed.
 *
 * ## What belongs in this file
 *
 * **Only what more than one file needs, and only if it is a fact about the
 * arrangement rather than a fact about one component.** Both halves matter. A
 * dimension with one call site stays with the component that owns it, and the
 * two that are deliberately absent are worth naming so the next reader can see
 * the line was drawn rather than forgotten:
 *
 *   - the drawer's `w-[min(85vw,320px)]` cap (`sidebar-drawer.tsx`), which no
 *     other file reasons about, and
 *   - the rail's width, which is never declared numerically at all - it falls
 *     out of `size-(--control-lg)` and its padding, and inventing a constant
 *     for it would be describing the code rather than deciding anything.
 *
 * The sidebar's and the settings panel's widths *are* here, and were not always.
 * They stayed put while this file lived in `app/`, because hoisting them would
 * have made `items/` depend on `app/` while `app/` already depended on `items/`.
 * That cycle is gone: `layout/` imports nothing from the application, so the
 * objection died with the folder. What justifies the move is the third copy -
 * `pane-state.ts` reasons about both numbers while owning neither, and had them
 * written out in prose.
 *
 * ## The class strings
 *
 * These are strings rather than components on purpose. The precedent is
 * `packages/ui/src/primitives/interaction.ts`, which does the same for
 * `focusRing` and the wash states: a shared class list is composed at the call
 * site, so a caller can still add to it, and nothing new appears in the DOM or
 * in the accessibility tree. A `<Pane>` component would add a wrapper element
 * to every one of these positions, and the role inventories the view tests
 * assert against would all have to move.
 *
 * Composing them by interpolation is safe for Tailwind's extractor, which
 * matches class names in source text: every utility below appears as a literal
 * in this file, so `paneColumn` interpolating `paneClip` contributes nothing
 * the extractor still needs to find. Compose freely; do not build a class name
 * out of fragments.
 *
 * They live in the app rather than in `packages/ui` because they encode this
 * shell's arrangement - a fixed tree beside a document beside a settings panel -
 * which is not something a design system should know.
 *
 * ## Why the widths are written as pixels
 *
 * The standard is AGENTS.md's: never hard-code a px value **the tokens carry**.
 * So the question at every raw number is which token would carry it, and the
 * sheet's answer is bounded - a type scale, a control-height scale and a
 * spacing base (ADR-0008). Those answer "how big is this text", "how tall is
 * this control" and "how much room is between things", and every one of those
 * in the shell and the views is a class off a scale.
 *
 * None of them answers "how wide is the sidebar". **The test a reader applies
 * is whether the number is a step of rhythm or a dimension chosen against the
 * screen.** A step of rhythm belongs to the scale and has to come from it. A
 * dimension - a panel's width, an overlay's cap, a popover's height - was
 * picked by looking at a composition, is checked by looking at one, and is
 * written as the pixel value it is. Restating it as a multiple of `--spacing`
 * would turn a number a reader can measure off a screenshot into one they
 * cannot, and would claim a scale membership the sheet does not grant.
 *
 * Two consequences worth naming. Giving those dimensions tokens is a change to
 * the token sheet rather than to a component, so it is decided there and not
 * here. And narrowing them for small screens is the responsive goal's work: a
 * fixed sidebar width is on the MVP-2.5 defect list already, and it is a
 * behaviour change rather than a taste one.

/**

 * still too wide from painting over its neighbour - shrinking and clipping are

 * Overflow 3, when one axis is not `visible` the other's `visible` computes to
 * `auto`, so this element is a scroll container on *both* axes and
 * `overflow-y-auto` and `overflow-auto` compute identically. Verified in a
 * browser, not assumed.
 *
 * What actually keeps the horizontal axis out of the pane's hands is the view
 * inside it: `min-w-0` lets the pane shrink to the space available, and every
 * view wide enough to need it carries its own `overflow-x-auto`, which
 * constrains its content to the pane's width so the pane's own horizontal
 * scroller never has anything to scroll. A wide view that does *not* bring one
