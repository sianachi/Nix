/**
 * The list view: a container's children as a table, edited in place.
 *
 * The plainest of the three views and the one every container falls back to, so it is also the one
 * that has to be right about the least interesting things - what the columns are, what order the
 * rows are in, and above all what it says when there are no rows. Those five answers are not
 * decided here: they are the shared view chrome, which the board and the calendar also ask, because
 * four copies of one decision is four chances to drop the branch nobody meets while building.
 *
 * **Every cell is a control, always drawn as one.** Not click-to-edit: that needs a focus transfer
 * effect of its own, and it hides from a screen reader the one fact the table is trying to convey,
 * which is that these values can be changed. The cost is a tab stop per cell - kept, deliberately:
 * goal 3.8 adds Alt+Arrow cell-to-cell movement (`./cell-nav.ts`) rather than roving tabindex, so
 * this table never trades a long tab order for the focus-restoration problem a roving tabindex
 * would reopen on every re-sort, optimistic update and refusal rollback (see the note below).
 *
 * **Plain table semantics.** A real `<table>` with `<th scope="row">` row headers, not `role="grid"`
 * with a roving tabindex. A roving tabindex is focus state with no source - it cannot come from the
 * URL - so it would be local state plus an effect moving DOM focus, and focus jumping on a re-sort,
 * on an optimistic update or on a refusal rollback is worse than a long tab order.
 *
 * **The sort is not held here.** It lives in the URL, because a sorted table that cannot be linked
 * or restored by the back button is a table somebody has to re-sort every time they arrive. This
 * component reads the sort out of `useViewState` and writes a header click back to it; between
 * those two the state is the address bar's, and React re-renders because the address changed.
