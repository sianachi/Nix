 * is choosing which *properties* to show and in what order - it is not choosing whether the row
 * says what it is - so a `title` entry in that list is dropped rather than rendered twice.
 *
 * A configured column whose property is not in the schema still gets a column, headed by its key.
 * The alternative is dropping it silently, which turns a renamed property into a column that
 * vanished for no stated reason; a column of blanks under an unfamiliar heading at least says
 * where to look.
