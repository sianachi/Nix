/**
 * One editable cell in the list.
 *
 * **The refusal belongs to the cell, not to the table.** A write is refused for one property of one
 * item, and a banner above the table that says so leaves somebody counting rows to find which cell
 * it is about. So the answer to a cell's own edit is held here, beside the control that asked -
 * which is also why the list does not draw the container's `writeError`: the cell has already
 * reported it, and drawing both is two banners for one failure.
 *
 * **Held at the nearest durable UI boundary.** A standalone cell owns the refusal locally. A
 * virtualized list supplies the optional controlled value so unmounting an off-screen row does not
 * erase its refusal. It still stays outside `useContainer`: this is the answer to one edit attempt,
 * not server data for the container to mirror and clear.
 *
 * The control itself is `PropertyInput`, unchanged in behaviour: it already commits typed values on
 * blur or Enter and discrete ones on the choice, so a cell writes once per completed edit and never
 * once per keystroke.
