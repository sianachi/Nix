/**
 * The height of one hour, in pixels, and **the one place in the app that still sets `style`**.
 *
 * The grid is a coordinate space rather than a rhythm, which is what makes it the exception to the
 * ban in `app.css`. An item at 09:30 sits at `9.5 * ROW_HEIGHT` down the column - a number that
 * exists only once its timestamp has been read and converted into the reader's zone, so it is
 * computed at render. Expressing that as a class would need one utility per reachable offset, 1440
 * of them at minute resolution, and Tailwind's extractor cannot see a class name assembled from a
 * variable anyway - so the sheet would ship none of them. Rounding to a coarser set would place
 * items at times they are not at, which is the one thing a calendar must not do.
 *
 * It is 56px - twice `MIN_SPAN_HEIGHT_PX` below - so that half an hour is exactly the shortest box
 * a span is ever drawn as. At the 44px it used to be, anything under about thirty-eight minutes was
 * drawn the same height, so a half-hour item and a three-quarter-hour one could not be told apart
 * and stretching an item below that did nothing a reader could see. Now thirty minutes and every
 * quarter hour above it is drawn at its true length. It is used in arithmetic rather than applied
 * as a length, so it is written as the scalar the arithmetic needs.
 *
 * The row heights below could be classes; they are not, because they have to agree with the offsets
 * exactly. The same number said twice, once in a class and once in arithmetic, is how a grid drifts
 * an hour at a time.
 *
 * Exported so a test that needs a pixel offset computes it from this number rather than restating
 * it by hand - a second copy of `44` in a test file is the same drift risk one step removed.

 * cannot bleed into the row below it, see the span's own comment - clipped its Reschedule button
 * along with them, shrinking its hit area under the 24px floor WCAG 2.5.8 sets. Clamping the
 * height rather than lifting the clip keeps the box's top exactly where the item starts; only the
 * bottom ever moves, and only when the real duration would have drawn a box too short to hold its
 * own control.

 * hour gutter already had, extended to every column rather than just the leftmost one.
 *
 * `min-w-0 flex-1` used to let seven columns divide up whatever width the viewport offered with no
 * floor, which on a phone is around 47px each: too narrow for the event card below to show a title
 * next to its time, and the column kept shrinking instead of the grid ever scrolling.
 *
 * 7rem (112px) is sized off what the card actually draws, not guessed: the event button sits
 * `inset-x-1` inside the column (4px a side) and pads itself `px-1.5` (6px a side), which leaves
 * about 92px of text at `text-xs` - comfortably one truncated title on its own line and a short time
 * like "09:00" on the one below, the two lines the card usually renders (a cross-zone entry's time
 * span carries its own `truncate` too, for the rarer third line a zone name can add). Below that a
 * title stops being a title and starts being an ellipsis before the second word. `sm:min-w-[9rem]`
 * widens it a touch once there is room, the way timeline-view.tsx's `LABEL_COLUMN` widens its own
 * floor at the same breakpoint.
 *
 * `[contain:inline-size]` stops a different failure than the floor above: without it, a browser
 * computing this row's max-content width (needed once the row has to overflow rather than shrink)
 * looks *through* a `flex-1` column at its children's own natural width - so one long all-day title
 * anywhere in the week inflates that column's contribution to hundreds of pixels, and flexbox's
 * max-content algorithm then multiplies that single widest column's width across every other
 * `flex-1` sibling, blowing the whole row out past 2000px. `contain: inline-size` tells the browser
 * this element's own intrinsic size is whatever its explicit `min-width`/`flex-basis` says, full
 * stop - it does not go looking at what is drawn inside. Verified in both week (7 columns) and day
 * (1 column) mode: a long all-day title no longer moves the row's width at all.
