                 push the band's rows apart. The pseudo-element widens what a pointer has to hit
                 without widening what the eye sees - the same technique, with the same reasoning,
                 as @nix/ui's PaneDivider grab band. `-inset-y-1` is one spacing step (3.4px) past
                 each edge, which clears the floor with room for the density to tighten. The
                 column's `gap-2` is what gives those extensions somewhere to go; see it above. */
