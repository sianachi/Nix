/**
 * The keyboard road to the same write a drag performs, in a modal.
 *
 * Shared by every place an item sits on a calendar and can be moved: the month card, a timed item
 * placed on an hour grid, and the collated calendar's own month cell. All three used to answer only
 * to a pointer - a drag was the sole way to reschedule a card that had already landed somewhere - so
 * this is the one dialog every caller opens instead of reaching for its own copy.
 *
 * A modal rather than a form swapped into the card's place, because the card's place is often a
 * `w-[6.5rem]` month column and a native date input needs roughly 120px to draw its value - the old
 * inline form rendered a control that could not show the date being typed into it.
 *
 * The draft starts as the date the item has now, when it has one. What the form must not do is
 * guess: a draft that is not a `yyyy-MM-dd` date, or not a full `datetime-local` value, is refused
 * here, in the field that can say so, rather than written and refused by Core.
 *
 * **A view with an end-date property configured gets a second field, for the same reason the hour
 * grid stopped being a pointer-only surface.** A timed item's length used to answer to nothing at
 * all - no drag resized it, because nothing drew it as a shape with two ends to begin with, and no
 * keyboard path existed either. `endDateProperty` names the property that closes the span; passing
 * it draws a matching end field, prefilled from the item, and `submit` refuses an end that lands
 * before the start rather than sending the pair to Core to be refused.
