 * container's calendar, which can create, drag and reschedule, and the workspace's collated
 * calendar, which reads across containers and cannot do any of those, because the write would have
 * to guess which container's property it meant. Sharing the whole cell would mean either giving the
 * collated view controls that do nothing, or bolting optional-ness onto the container view's cell
 * and putting its whole test suite in the blast radius. Sharing the table instead hands each caller
 * the part that is genuinely the same: the weekday header, the blanks either end, the accessible
 * name of every day, and the scroll region below.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock or a zone. The month is given, and `todayText` is passed in, so the
 * grid is a pure function of its arguments and the two callers cannot disagree about what day it is.

      The scroller sits *outside* the frame, and the arithmetic is why. The table's floor is 728px
      (`MONTH_GRID_MIN_WIDTH`), and around it stand the frame's 2px of border and its 24px of `p-3`.
      With the scroller inside the frame, a container a little wider than the table's floor had a
      region narrower than it, so the last column slid under the frame's right border - clipped
      against a hairline rather than visibly scrollable. Because the frame now travels with the
      table, the last column ends at the frame's own edge instead of under it.

      `role="region"` plus a tab stop, matching timeline-view.tsx's and calendar-hours.tsx's own
      scrollable tracks: without one, this axis is reachable by keyboard only by tabbing through
      every focusable control inside it. `<Blueprint>` cannot carry any of this itself - it forwards
      only `children`, `as` and `className` - so the scroll moves to this plain wrapper. `min-w-fit`
      on the frame is what makes its box span the true scroll-content width - the pane's width when
      there is room, the table's floor when there is not. It was `min-w-max`, and the max-content
      width of a `table-fixed` table that is itself `width: 100%` is not a real number: Chrome
      resolved it to a million pixels, each day column came out 142,857px wide, and the month drew
      as a single column of Mondays with the other six days far off to the right; jsdom cannot verify any
      of the layout above, so the classes here are asserted as a contract in calendar-view.test.tsx.
