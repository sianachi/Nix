/**
 * A container's children on a month grid, placed by the view's date property.
 *
 * **Placement is a text comparison, start to finish.** Dates are stored as `yyyy-MM-dd` with no
 * time and no zone precisely so that a property meaning "the 3rd" is the 3rd for everybody, and the
 * moment this file turned one of those strings into a `Date` to decide a cell, it would stop being
 * true: `new Date('2026-03-01')` is UTC midnight, which is the 28th of February for every reader
 * west of Greenwich. So the grid is built from integer arithmetic on the year and month numbers,
 * each cell knows its own `yyyy-MM-dd` text, and an item lands in the cell whose text equals its
 * property. No `Date` is ever constructed from a stored value - the only clock reading in this file
 * is "what is today where this person is sitting", which is a local question and is asked once.
 *
 * **Where an item sits is its date.** Dragging a card to a day and using the per-item reschedule
 * control do the same single thing: write the date property. Nothing about placement is view-local,
 * so two people looking at the same folder through different views cannot disagree about when
 * something is due.
 *
 * **The keyboard path is not a courtesy.** A calendar whose only way to move an item is a drag is a
 * calendar a person using a keyboard or a screen reader cannot operate at all, so every card
 * carries a reschedule control that reaches the same write.
 *
 * **An item with an `endDateProperty` covers every day between the two, drawn on each one**
 * (`spanDates`), rather than only on its start day with a marker saying it continues. A month
 * cell is already a list of cards, not a single-line row a bar could stretch across the way
 * timeline-view.tsx draws one, so showing the same card again on every covered day costs this
 * file one loop and no new layout, and is the one rendering that agrees with "where an item sits
 * is its date" above for a date range rather than a single date.
