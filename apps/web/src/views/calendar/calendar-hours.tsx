 * evening before. Placing it without converting would put it in the right-looking slot for whoever
 * wrote it and the wrong one for everybody else, and it would look correct from the author's desk.
 *
 * An item whose zone differs from the reader's says so on the card. One whose zone matches says
 * nothing extra: repeating "Europe/London" beside every entry for somebody in London trains people
 * to stop reading it, and then it is not there when it matters.
 *
 * **All-day items are not on the grid.** A `date` property means "the 3rd" and has no hour to be
 * placed at; converting one into a moment to find a row is precisely the bug the date type exists
 * to avoid. They sit in a band above the hours, where a calendar has always put them.
