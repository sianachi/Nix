/**
 * Gives a container's calendar an end property, from outside that container's own page.
 *
 * The container's calendar view does this through the container it already holds. The collated
 * calendar holds entries from many containers and none of their schemas, so it reads the one it
 * needs, adds an "End" property shaped like the start, and points the calendar view at it - in the
 * same single write, for the same reason: a property added without the view using it would leave
 * the reader with no sign of why items still cannot be stretched.
 *
 * "The calendar view" is the container's first one, which is the one the workspace calendar itself
 * places that container's items by.
 *
 * Returns why it could not be done, or null when it was - or when there was nothing to do.
