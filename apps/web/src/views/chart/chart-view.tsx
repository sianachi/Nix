/**
 * The chart view: a container's children summarised into bars, columns, a pie, lines, areas or a
 * year grid.
 *
 * **The third kind whose data is not the loaded children.** Its buckets come from
 * `GET /items/{id}/chart`, computed over every child rather than over the page the container
 * happens to hold - a chart tallied in the browser from the first two hundred of three thousand
 * would be a picture of the first page presented as a picture of the whole. `container.children` is
 * deliberately ignored, and so is `useViewChrome`, whose filter and sort branches are statements
 * about children this view does not draw.
 *
 * **One source for every option.** The chart's type, period, split, window and line options are all
 * read from the server's payload - the stored configuration the buckets were computed from - never
 * mixed with the client's copy of the view, which may already be newer. A change to the stored view
 * changes its fingerprint, and the chart is read again.
 *
 * **Every type is a table that happens to be drawn.** The numbers are text in the markup and the
 * drawing is `aria-hidden` decoration over them, so a screen reader gets the figures rather than a
 * description of a picture, and a copy-paste gets data. Bars keep the oldest form of that rule - the
 * bar sits behind its own row - and every other type draws above a table of the same figures. The
 * year grid's days carry their sentences, with the full table behind a disclosure because a year of
 * days is a long table.
 *
 * **Unset is a bar, and undated and out-of-window are said.** A container half of whose children
 * have no status is mostly a container of unset things, and dropping that bucket would misreport
 * every proportion beside it. On a time axis an item with no date, or one outside the window, has
 * no period to sit in, so it is counted and the chart says how many rather than quietly shrinking.
