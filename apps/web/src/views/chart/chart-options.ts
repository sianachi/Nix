/**
 * Keeping a chart view's options consistent with what it groups by, before it is saved.
 *
 * Core refuses a line, an area or a year grid without a period, and draws a chart with a period as
 * a time axis whatever it groups by. So whenever the grouping property or the type changes, the
 * draft is brought back to something Core will store and draw as shown: a date gets a period (a
 * month, unless one was chosen), a select loses its period, window and time-axis type, and a type
 * that cannot be split loses its split. Without this a person could pick "Due date" and save a
 * chart that counts one bar per distinct day.
