/**
 * The gallery: a container's children as a grid of cards, each optionally showing a cover picture.
 *
 * **The cover is not a requirement, and that is the decision this whole file is shaped around.** A
 * board with no grouping property has no columns, so it says so instead of drawing; a calendar with
 * no date property has nowhere to put anything. A gallery with no cover property is a grid of
 * titled cards - readable, useful, and what most galleries are on the day somebody makes one. So
 * this view is never undrawable: every path below ends in every item being on screen, and the four
 * things that can be wrong with a cover are said *on* or *above* the cards rather than instead of
 * them.
 *
 * **Four cases, four different sentences**, because collapsing any two of them tells somebody
 * something untrue:
 *
 *   - The view names no cover property. Cards are titles and properties, and there is no picture
 *     region at all. Not a grey box: a placeholder is a claim that something is loading.
 *   - A cover is configured and this item has no value. The frame says "No cover" in words. Not an
 *     empty box, which is indistinguishable from a failed load and from a white picture.
 *   - A cover is configured, the item has one, and it will not load. The frame says so, names the
 *     property to correct, and keeps the address readable. It must not fall back to the case above,
 *     which would claim the item has no cover when what it has is a broken one - and would send
 *     somebody to re-enter a URL that is already correct.
 *   - The cover property was deleted or retyped. Every card draws coverless and a notice above the
 *     grid names the property. The items are the container's; the property was somebody else's
 *     edit, and losing sight of the items over it would be the worst answer available.
 *
 * **A file item's thumbnail is one more source for the picture region, and the lowest.** Where a
 * card would otherwise have no cover - none configured, the property lost, or no value on this
 * item - a file card draws its own thumbnail (the worker's JPEG for images, cover art and EPUBs),
 * or a glyph for its kind where it has none, in the same fixed frame. A configured cover with a
 * value is never displaced, broken or not. The gallery holds no file records, so the thumbnail is
 * asked for lazily, only for cards that are on screen and only for file items whose name says they
 * could have one; a miss is an answer and not an error. Non-file items make no request.
 * PDFs are not drawn here: their first page is rendered in the browser from the whole file, and
 * without a byte length the gallery cannot tell a page from a book.
 *
 * **Two more that the four-way telling misses, and both draw an empty box if you let them:**
 *
 *   - *Still loading.* Every cover below the fold is in this state on first paint, because they are
 *     lazy. An unframed `img` with nothing in it yet is precisely the empty box the second case
 *     forbids, so the picture region is **always** a drawn frame and the picture fills it - the
 *     geometry is identical in all states and never changes as covers resolve.
 *   - *A value that is not a fetchable address.* Retyping a text property to Picture does not
 *     revalidate what is already stored, so `cover: "draft notes"` is reachable without the server
 *     ever having seen it. Handed to an `img` it resolves against this origin, fetches the
 *     application shell, and reports as a failed load - a request fired at our own server, per
 *     card, for something nobody attempted to load. It gets its own sentence instead.
