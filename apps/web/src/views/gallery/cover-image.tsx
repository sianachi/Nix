/**
 * The one place a cover picture is drawn.
 *
 * **Covers go through `<Duotone>`**, which is the design grammar's answer for any image
 * (AGENTS.md, styling rules): it maps the picture's luminance onto two token colours so a wall of
 * arbitrary photographs reads as one surface rather than as somebody's camera roll. This file
 * existed first as a seam - a plain `<img>` with exactly Duotone's interface - because the two were
 * built in parallel and the treatment did not exist yet. It now forwards to the real thing, and the
 * props did not have to move.
 *
 * **A component rather than an `<img>` inlined in the card**, so that seam is one place. A gallery
 * that wrote its own picture per state would have three by the time the covers, their failures and
 * their empty case were all drawn, and this swap would have been three edits with two chances to
 * leave one behind.
 *
 * **What moved off this file and into Duotone**, because they belong to whatever renders a picture
 * rather than to the gallery: `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` - a privacy boundary and not a nicety,
 * since a cover URL is arbitrary third-party and without it every reader's browser announces a
 * workspace address carrying the item id to a host nobody here controls or can audit - along with
 * `decoding="async"` and the lazy default. Duotone sets all three and its own tests hold them, so
 * this file no longer restates them.
 *
 * **`src` is not always a web address.** A cover set from a chosen or dropped file - see
 * `properties/image-value.tsx` - stores a reference to an uploaded file item rather than an
 * address, because there is no public URL for one (AGENTS.md: files use capability URLs, never
 * Core bytes). This is the one place that reference is resolved to something `<Duotone>` can
 * fetch: a local object URL. The gallery card above stays unaware of which kind of value it is
 * passing down.
 *
 * **An uploaded cover is drawn from its stored thumbnail, not from the file.** A wall of cards
 * that each downloaded an original photograph to fill a frame a few hundred pixels wide was the
 * slowest thing a gallery did. The thumbnail is a small JPEG the worker already made, behind the
 * same Core authorisation as the file. The original is fetched only where it is needed: when the
 * file has no thumbnail (a vector image, or one the worker has not reached yet), and behind the
 * thumbnail when the caller says the frame is larger than a thumbnail can fill sharply.
