 * of drawing one.** Four things can be true of an item that no bar can express - it has no end, its
 * end is before its start, it is off the window, it has no start at all - and none of them is
 * allowed to remove the item from the screen or to be described as one of the other three. Two of
 * them are one silent `Math.min` away from looking correct and being a lie about the data.
 *
 * **The suite runs in `Pacific/Honolulu`, ten hours west of UTC**, for the reason both calendar
 * suites do: a bar placed from a value that was turned into a `Date` lands a day early for every
