/**
 * The spreadsheet body: a cell grid over a Yjs document, synchronised through
 * the same collaboration service, transport and presence as the note and
 * canvas bodies - a body kind, not a second system.
 *
 * The document shape and the formula engine live in `@nix/sheet`, which the
 * collaboration service also imports: an update this editor produces is
 * validated by the same code that produced it, and the values a colleague
 * sees are computed by the same engine that computed yours. Unlike the
 * canvas, the grid needs no reconciliation binding - the shared `Y.Map` it
 * reads and writes through `useSheet` already is the state, the same way
 * `ySyncPlugin` makes the shared fragment the note's state.
 *
 * Keyed on the item by its caller, exactly as the other bodies are, so
 * switching items builds a fresh document rather than merging two.
