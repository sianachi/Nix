/**
 * Whether a title being typed for a new item already names something - here, or anywhere in the
 * workspace.
 *
 * Two sources, answered separately because they fail separately:
 *
 * - **The container's loaded children**, compared locally. Cheap, always available, and the most
 *   likely place for the duplicate to be.
 * - **Workspace search**, for the copy that lives somewhere else. The search endpoint ranks by
 *   relevance, not by similarity, so its hits are re-scored here with the same trigram measure
 *   and the same bar, and only hits in the current workspace count - the endpoint searches every
 *   workspace the caller can read, and a duplicate in somebody's other workspace is not a reason
 *   to hesitate here.
 *
 * **A failed search says nothing.** Not "no duplicates": the honest answer to a request that did
 * not complete is no answer, and a sentence claiming the workspace was checked would be a claim
 * about results that never arrived. The local comparison still stands on its own.
 *
 * **Debounced and cancellable** on the reference picker's pattern (`editor/reference-menu.tsx`): a
 * request per settled title rather than per keystroke, each aborted when the title moves on or the
 * control closes, and an answer that carries the query it answers so a late response for an old
 * title is never shown against a new one. Outside an `ApiClientProvider` - a story, a unit test, a
 * public page - the search half simply does not run.
