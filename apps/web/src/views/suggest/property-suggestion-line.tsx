 * One property value offered for a new item, or one the person has already taken.

 * **The reason is part of the suggestion.** "Suggested Category: Bills - 8 of the 10 items with
 * 'invoice' in the title and a Category set use Bills" can be checked against the list the person
 * is looking at, and says exactly which items were counted; a bare "Bills?" can only be trusted or
 * not. The model only offers a reason that supports the value (at least half the counted items). The counts are the model's own evidence for its strongest word (see
 * `naive-bayes.ts`), never a confidence percentage, because "86%" invites a precision the
 * arithmetic does not have.
