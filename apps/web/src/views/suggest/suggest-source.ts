 * keys both the trained models and the workspace search.
 *
 * Its own module, apart from `create-suggestions.tsx`, so a view can describe its source without
 * pulling the suggestion code (the classifier, the similarity search) into its own chunk: the
 * create control loads that lazily, only once somebody opens a create field.
