/**
 * Which property values a new item probably wants, learned from its siblings' titles.
 *
 * The container-shaped half of the property-value suggester: `lib/suggest/naive-bayes.ts` knows
 * how to learn "words to a label" and nothing about items, and this file knows which properties
 * are categorical enough to learn, how their values are stored, and what a suggestion has to be
 * before it may be written back.
 *
 * **Three property types are learned, because only these are categories.** A select and a
 * multi-select draw from a declared list, and an assignee from the workspace's members - so the
 * same few values recur across siblings and a title's words can say something about which one
 * applies. A text property's values are as varied as its titles; a date, a number or a checkbox has
 * no category for a word to point at. Anything else is skipped.
 *
 * **A select value is only suggested if the schema still declares it.** A sibling may hold a value
 * from before an option was renamed; suggesting it would offer a write the server refuses. The
 * assignee has no declared list - its values are principals - so it is learned as stored.
