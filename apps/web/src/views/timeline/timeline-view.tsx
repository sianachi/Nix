/**
 * A container's children as bars across a time axis, placed by a start date and an optional end.
 *
 * **All of the arithmetic is in `timeline-scale.ts` and none of it is here.** Which column a day
 * falls in, how many columns a quarter takes, and whether a span misses the window entirely are
 * questions that can be asked directly of that module; asked of this one they could only be
 * answered by counting cells on a rendered screen. Nothing in this file constructs a `Date` from a
 * stored value, for the reason the calendar's header sets out at length: `new Date('2026-03-01')`
 * is UTC midnight, which is the previous day for every reader west of Greenwich.
 *
 * **The start is `dateProperty` - the calendar's field, under the calendar's name.** That is what
 * makes switching a view between calendar and timeline lossless, and it is why there is no
 * `startDateProperty` anywhere in the system. The end is a second field and is genuinely optional.
 *
 * **Five things can be true of an item that a bar cannot draw, and each gets its own sentence**,
 * because collapsing any two of them puts something untrue on the screen:
 *
 *   - *A start and no end.* A milestone: a marker on the start day. Not a zero-width bar, and
 *     emphatically not a bar drawn to today - extending it would invent an end date nobody entered,
 *     and it would grow every morning.
 *   - *An end before its start.* Neither swapped nor clamped. It is stated in a band below the
 *     grid, showing both dates, with the same reschedule control the bars have. Swapping would
 *     silently correct a data error somebody may need to see; the server does not refuse the pair
 *     either, because two independent property writes cannot both be valid at every instant.
 *   - *Entirely outside the window.* Counted above the grid and listed below it, so it stays
 *     reachable. A window is a scroll position through time and an item is not less real for being
 *     off it. A bar that only partly overlaps is drawn clipped, with a marker at the cut end - and
 *     its accessible name carries the dates it really has, never the ones it was truncated to.
 *   - *No start at all.* The unscheduled list, exactly as the calendar keeps one. A timeline that
 *     dropped undated items would lose half a folder without saying so.
 *   - *A start that is not a date.* Its own band, and told apart from the one above deliberately.
 *     Retyping a text property to Date does not revalidate what is already stored, so `starts:
 *     "next Tuesday"` is reachable, and filing it under "no start date yet" would send somebody
 *     looking for a value that is sitting right there. `PropertyInput` already refuses to overwrite
 *     such a value; this refuses to misdescribe it.
 *
 * **The bars are read-only in this build, and the keyboard path is the only path.** There is no
 * drag-a-range primitive anywhere in this application - the board and the calendar's month grid
 * both drag a *point*, and the hour grid has no drag at all - and a range needs pointer capture, a
 * ghost, snap-to-day arithmetic and an edge-versus-body hit test. That is a goal of its own. Both
 * views that do have a drag also have keyboard parity, so shipping a drag here without one would be
 * the first break in that pattern. What ships instead is the reschedule disclosure every item
 * carries, which reaches the same two writes a drag eventually will.
 *
 * **There is no `writeError` banner here, and that is a decision rather than an omission.**
 * `useContainer` answers a refused write on two channels - the returned reason, and the
 * `writeError` field - and its contract says a caller reads one and never both. The second exists
 * for a gesture nobody awaits: a dragged card has already snapped back and is not a place to put a
 * sentence. Every write this view makes is awaited, so the refusal goes in the field that caused
 * it, and a banner as well would say the same thing twice in two places at once.
