 * Where a timeline's columns are, and which of them a span covers.

 * **All of the timeline's arithmetic and none of its React**, for the same reason `calendar-dates`
 * exists: a grid whose day-to-column mapping is only reachable by rendering it is a grid whose
 * off-by-one is only findable by counting pixels. Everything below is integers and `yyyy-MM-dd`
 * text, and it is built entirely from `calendar-dates` - this module adds no date arithmetic of its
 * own, because a second implementation of "what is the next day" is a second place for February to
 * be wrong.
 *
 * **No `Date` is constructed from a stored value here, ever.** `new Date('2026-03-01')` is UTC
 * midnight, which is the 28th of February for every reader west of Greenwich, so a bar placed that
 * way starts a day early for half the world and looks right on the machine of whoever wrote it. The
 * one value that legitimately becomes a moment is a `timestamp` property, and it is converted to the
 * reader's day by `timestamps.ts` before it reaches any comparison here.
 *
 * **Dates are compared as text.** `yyyy-MM-dd` sorts the way the days do, so "does this bar start
 * before the window" is a string comparison and cannot disagree with "which column does it land in".
