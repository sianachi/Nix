/**
 * The smart lists this browser knows about in each workspace, for the rail's Smart lists section
 * (plan 1.8) - each an item whose default view is a `query`.
 *
 * **Learned, not listed.** Core has no read for "every item whose default view is a query", and
 * this lane adds no endpoint (plan 1.8 is pure web), so the list is what this browser has seen:
 * an item opened whose default view turns out to be a query is remembered, one that has since
 * stopped being one is forgotten, one deleted here or found missing when opened is dropped, and
 * one made from the rail's "New smart list" is remembered as it is opened. The menu's first entry
 * always reads "Smart lists opened in this browser", so the list is never presented as the
 * workspace's complete set. A Core read lands with the query endpoint (plan 1.1), and this store
 * is what it replaces.
 *
 * **Pinning is a person's arrangement of their own rail**, so it is browser-local like the page
 * guides and the panel width, not a write to the item that everybody would see.
