/**

 * filter editor, waiting for the person to save or discard them.
 *
 * **The proposal goes into the editor, not into the view.** Inferred rules are appended to the
 * rules the smart list already has and handed to `FilterRulesEditor` as a draft - the same editor
 * the setup studio uses, so every rule can be read, changed or removed before anything is stored.
 * Saving is the ordinary view write; discarding leaves the smart list exactly as it was. Nothing
 * here ever runs a query with rules the person has not saved.
 *
 * **Each rule says how much it narrows, and over what.** The counts are over the rows this smart
 * list is showing right now - a server-limited, possibly truncated set - so the sentence names
 * that set rather than claiming a number for the whole workspace. Saving runs the real query.
