 * exactly the calls the rest of the application already makes, so everything a move refuses - a
 * lock, an item that accepts no children, a move into its own subtree - is refused here by the
 * same server code rather than by a second set of rules the outline would have to keep in step.
 *
 * An interface rather than calls inline in the view so the view can be driven by a test or a story
 * without a network behind it.
