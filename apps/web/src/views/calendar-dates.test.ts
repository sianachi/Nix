 * The arithmetic a calendar is built from.

 * Tested here directly rather than through the grid. The month view's leap-year behaviour is
 * currently asserted by clicking "next month" twenty-three times, which proves the same thing and
 * says nothing about where it broke when it breaks.
 *
 * Every case below is one a `Date` would have got wrong, or one where an off-by-one hides: a month
 * boundary, a year boundary, February in a leap year, February in a century that is not one.
