/**
 * Making a child from inside a view.
 *
 * One control, three placements: under a list, at the foot of a board column, inside a day on a
 * calendar. Each supplies the property that puts the new item where it was asked for, so creating
 * something *in* a column is one gesture rather than a create followed by a drag followed by an
 * edit.
 *
 * **It is a button and a field, and nothing else.** No landmark, no region, no status. The three
 * view suites assert exact role inventories - the board compares the full list of regions, the list
 * compares its row headers and expects a single cell, the calendar expects one status and one alert
 * - so an affordance that introduced any of those would break assertions that are about the view
 * rather than about this. The only role it adds is a button, and an alert when a write is refused.
 *
 * **Closed until asked for.** A text field in every column and every day would be forty input
 * fields on a month, all reachable by tab, none of them wanted. The button opens one.
 *
 * **Suggestions, when the view supplies something to learn from.** Given `suggest`, the open field
 * offers likely property values for the title being typed and says when a similar item already
 * exists (`suggest/create-suggestions.tsx`), unless "Suggestions in views" is switched off. Those
 * lines add buttons and one `sr-only` polite count, never a landmark, region or status, so the
 * inventory promise above still holds. Until the suggestion code has loaded nothing is drawn in
 * their place: they are an aid, and the field works without them. An accepted value
 * rides along with the create's own properties; nothing is written for a suggestion nobody took.
