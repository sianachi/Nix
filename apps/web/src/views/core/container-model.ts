 * schemas here additionally carry `satisfies` ties to the generated contract - the same idiom
 * `packages/api-client/src/schemas/item.ts` uses, and for the same reason: a field Core renames

 * happens. It does not catch a field this schema invents: an extra key the contract never carried
 * still satisfies the contract type, and typecheck stays green. So these ties are a floor - the
