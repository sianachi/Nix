/**
 * The five things every view has to say before it can say anything about items.
 *
 * Loading, could-not-be-read, cannot-be-drawn, genuinely-empty and hidden-by-filters are five
 * different facts, and each of the three views used to answer all five in its own words, in its own
 * order, with its own local panel shapes. Four copies of one decision is four chances for a view to
 * quietly drop a branch - and the branch a view drops is always the same one, because "the filters
 * are hiding everything" is the only one of the five that never happens while you are building it.
 *
 * **A hook, not a component.** What comes back is a node to render or the items to draw, and
 * nothing wraps the caller. A component here would put a landmark of its own inside every view, and
 * the board asserts its region inventory exactly - shared chrome must be invisible in the accessible
 * tree, not merely tidy in the source.
 *
 * **The words stay with the view; only the branching moves.** A board that cannot be drawn and a
 * calendar that cannot be drawn are wrong in different ways and say so in different sentences. This
 * decides *which* of the five holds; the caller says what that means for it.
 *
 * **The drawable payload rides along.** A view usually has one thing it must resolve before it can
 * draw - the board's grouping property, the calendar's date property - and that resolution is also
 * what decides the cannot-be-drawn branch. Handing it back through the result is what lets the
 * caller use it without re-checking something this function has already proved, and without an
 * unreachable branch to satisfy the compiler.
 *
 * Not built on `AsyncSection`: that consumes an `AsyncStatus<T>` no view produces, and adopting it
 * here is more ceremony than the branch it replaces. It is, however, the seam paginated containers
 * should converge on, at which point this function is what gets rewritten rather than every view.
