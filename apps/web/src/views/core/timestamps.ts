/**
 * Reading and writing a timestamp property.
 *
 * **One file knows how a stored value becomes a position on a grid**, so the calendar never
 * constructs a moment for itself and there is one place to look when a time is off by an hour.
 *
 * A timestamp is stored as RFC 9557 - a local time, the offset it was written at, and the zone it
 * belongs to:
 *
 * ```
 * 2026-03-17T09:00:00+00:00[Europe/London]
 * ```
 *
 * The zone is kept because the instant alone is not enough. A 09:00 Europe/London standup stored as
 * a moment becomes 10:00 London the day the clocks change: the instant survived and the meaning did
 * not. The server refuses a value whose offset disagrees with what its zone was doing at that
 * moment, so anything reaching here is internally consistent.
 *
 * **Luxon rather than a library that bundles the zone database.** The platform already carries it -
 * `Intl` reports several hundred IANA zones - so shipping a second copy would be paying in bytes
 * for something already installed. The cost is that Luxon resolves an ambiguous local time by
 * picking one rather than making the caller choose; the values this reads have already been through
 * a server that checked them, so that only matters at the moment one is written.
