/**
 * Which view is on screen, and how it is sorted and filtered - held in the URL.
 *
 * **The URL is this application's primary state container**, and a view is the clearest case for
 * it: "the board, grouped by status, filtered to this quarter, sorted by owner" is exactly the
 * thing somebody pastes into a message. Held in a store instead, every such link would point at
 * the folder's default view and the recipient would have to rebuild what they were sent.
 *
 * **The URL wins over the container's stored view, and that is deliberate.** A container stores
 * which views it offers and how each is configured; the URL says which of them is open and what
 * the person looking at it has done since. When the two disagree the URL is the more specific
 * statement - somebody chose it, just now, possibly in a link they were given - so the stored view
 * is the starting point rather than the authority.
 *
 * Sort and filter replace rather than push, so dragging a column header does not fill the back
 * button with history nobody wanted. Changing view pushes, because Back meaning "the board I was
 * just looking at" is what everybody expects.
