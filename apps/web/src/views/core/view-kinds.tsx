/**
 * Every kind of view this build can draw, and everything it knows about each one.
 *
 * **Adding a view kind is one entry in this table.** It used to be four edits that could not be
 * type-checked against each other - the kind list, an icon record, the editor's dropdown with its
 * hand-written configuration block, and a dispatch switch whose `default` case silently caught
 * anything new and drew it as a list. A kind added to three of those four compiled and shipped
 * looking like a list.
 *
 * The backend has the matching table in `backend/src/Nix.Api/Domain/Views/ViewDefinition.cs`. The
 * two are deliberately separate: the server decides what is *storable* (a board must name a
 * property to group by) and this decides what is *drawable*. They agree on the stored names and
 * nothing else, which is why an older build meeting a newer build's view says it cannot draw it
 * rather than crashing.
 *
 * There is a third per-kind table the promise does not reach: `packages/view-render/src/render.ts`
 * draws views inside exports, and a kind it has no renderer for falls back to a list with a note
 * naming the kind - honest, so a kind added to the two tables here ships without touching it. But
 * "adding a kind is one entry" is a per-table promise, not a repo-wide one; a kind that should
 * export as itself is a third entry there.
