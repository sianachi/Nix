/**
 * A board card that has gone untouched far longer than its column's cards usually do.
 *
 * **What it can honestly claim, and what it cannot.** The only clock an item carries is
 * `updatedAt`, which moves on *any* change - a column move, a renamed title, an edited property. So
 * "unchanged for 24 days" is exact, and it is a lower bound on how long the card has sat in its
 * column: a card edited yesterday may have been in "Doing" for a month. What the hint cannot do is
 * say where cards usually go next, which is what the board's version of this idea ideally offers -
 * that needs the history of column moves, and no such history reaches the client (Core keeps no
 * per-property transition log for items). So this is the conservative half only: a nudge to look,
 * dismissible, with no write attached. A dismissal is remembered until the card changes (see
 * `board-view.tsx` and `lib/suggestion-dismissals.ts`).
