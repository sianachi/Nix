/**
 * The board: a container's children as cards, in columns, grouped by one select property.
 *
 * **Where a card sits *is* its property value.** The board holds no position of its own - no
 * per-view ordering, no "which column is this card in" stored anywhere. Dropping a card into
 * "Done" writes `status = "Done"` and nothing else, so the same fact is true in the list view, in
 * search, and in whatever reads the property next. A board that kept its own copy of the placement
 * would have two answers to one question, and the day they disagreed the person would be right to
 * trust neither.
 *
 * **Columns are freely definable and are not the property's allowed values.** The view's
 * `groupOrder` names the columns and their order when it says anything at all; the property's
 * declared `options` are only the fallback for a view that has not chosen. This is deliberate and
 * load-bearing: a status property with six options can be shown as a three-column board in an
 * order somebody picked, and adding a seventh option must not silently rearrange every board in
 * the workspace. The cost is that a card whose value is not one of the chosen columns has nowhere
 * to sit, which this view reports rather than hides - see `hidden` below.
