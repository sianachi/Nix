/**
 * What this person usually puts in a form's fields, remembered from their own submissions.
 *
 * **"Their own" is this browser's record, because the server has no other.** An item carries no
 * author - `ItemResponse` has timestamps but no creator - so "the person's previous submissions to
 * this form" cannot be read back from the children; the children are everybody's submissions. What
 * can be known honestly is what was submitted from here, by whoever is signed in, which the
 * frecency store already scopes and clears at sign-out. So a successful submit records its values,
 * and the next blank form offers the usual one as a suggestion beside the field - never as a value
 * already filled in, which would be one unnoticed Enter away from a submission nobody chose.
 *
 * **Only choice fields are remembered.** Frecency keeps no document text (see `lib/frecency.ts`):
 * a select's option, a priority step, an assignee's principal id are all values the schema or the
 * workspace already names. An option label is still workspace content, which is why the store is
 * cleared whenever the signed-in subject changes. A text field's value is something a person wrote
 * into an item, and remembering it in browser storage is what that store promises not to do.
 *
 * Namespaced `form:<workspace>:<view>:<property>`, so two forms over one container keep separate
 * habits and nothing crosses workspaces.
