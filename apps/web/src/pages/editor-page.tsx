 * anything. That split was never in the schema - every row has always had a parent, a property
 * schema and a views column - so it was the interface refusing what the data allowed.
 *
 * What is left is two axes, and keeping them distinct is the thing to preserve here:
 *
 * - the item's **body**, which is its own content, and
 * - its **views**, which are ways of looking at its children.
 *
 * Only one is on screen at a time, so one switcher chooses, and the item remembers the choice. An
 * item nobody has configured a view on shows its body and no chrome whatsoever, which is every
 * plain note - the switcher returns nothing rather than offering a single "Document" tab.
 *
 * The tree is not here. It belongs to the shell, because it is how you move around the product
 * rather than part of this screen.
