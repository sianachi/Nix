 * announces itself; a truncated graph looks like a graph. A reader shown 2,000 of 3,000 items would
 * conclude two clusters are unconnected, which is a wrong answer rather than a missing one - so
 * whenever a flag is set this page says so above the drawing, and says which ceiling was hit.
 *
 * Opening a node presents the full item in a dialog while the graph stays mounted. Only the
 * explicit Open as page action changes the workspace destination.

 * a destination that only names itself once it has data leaves a reader on an untitled page in
 * exactly the moments they most need to know where they landed.
