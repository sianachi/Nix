/**
 * The calendar destination: every calendar in the workspace, drawn as one.
 *
 * A date set in one container used to be invisible from every other. This collates them, so a date
 * is a date wherever it was set - which is only true because the server resolves each container's
 * own date property rather than the client guessing one for the workspace.
 *
 * **Three things it admits to, and none of them are decoration.** The entry ceiling, because a
 * truncated list looks short and announces itself while a truncated calendar looks like a calendar.
 * Containers that offer a calendar and name no property, because a reader who cannot tell "nothing
 * is scheduled" from "that one could not be read" will believe the first. And entries whose stored
 * value this build cannot place, counted rather than dropped.
 *
 * Opening an item goes through the same `useOpenItem` the tree and the palette use, so an item
 * opened from here lands in the pane a reader expects. The calendar does not own a second idea of
 * what is open.
 */

 * The destination's frame: its heading, and whatever state it is in.
 *
 * The heading is outside the state fork on purpose. It answers "where am I", which is true while
 * the calendar is loading, true when it failed, and true when the workspace has nothing scheduled -
 * and a destination that only names itself once it has data leaves a reader on an untitled page in
 * exactly the moments they most need to know where they landed.
