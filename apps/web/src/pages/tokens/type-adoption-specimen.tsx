/**
 * The type adoption specimen: who owns the type scale, and where it is still owned locally.
 *
 * `TypeSpecimen` (`type-specimen.tsx`) proves the token sheet reaches the compiled CSS - five
 * lines, five steps, the pairing visibly intact. It cannot show what U11's sweep found, because
 * every line in it already goes through `<Text>`: nothing there can be doing it the other way.
 * What the sweep actually found was fifty-five text elements across `apps/web` dressing themselves
 * - `<p className="text-sm text-muted">Loading…</p>` and forty-odd of its cousins - each one made
 * of real tokens, correctly chosen, and none of them asking the primitive for anything.
 *
 * The cost of that is not that any one line looked wrong. It is that `--text-sm` was published by
 * the sheet, used about twenty times for one purpose, and named by no variant - so the step that
 * the interface talks about itself in existed everywhere and belonged to nobody. Naming it
 * (`note`) was possible only once the twenty sites were in one list.
 *
 * So this specimen has three parts, in the order a reviewer needs them:
 *
 *   - **The variant scale, doing its job.** Not "h1 through kicker" as labels, but the sentence
 *     each variant actually carries in the product. A scale is only legible as the set of
 *     decisions it settles, and "which of these two is a caption and which is a note" is a
 *     question the sizes alone do not answer.
 *   - **The tracking scale.** Five steps that arrived after `<Text>` did, which is why the
 *     primitive's own note about them was stale for a whole phase. They are shown at the sizes
 *     that ask for them, because the amount of air capitals need is a function of size and the
 *     ladder is unreadable at one size.
 *   - **The allowlist.** Every place a raw type class deliberately remains, and the reason.
 *     `scripts/check-text-primitive.sh` enforces the rule; this is where the exceptions are
 *     written down in prose, because a list of exceptions that lives only in a script is a list
 *     nobody reads until it fails them.
