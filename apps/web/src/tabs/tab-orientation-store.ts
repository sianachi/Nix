/**
 * Whether every pane's tab strip is a row above its content or a rail beside it.
 *
 * **One preference for the whole application, not one per pane.** This is a personal reading
 * preference - how the screen looks - rather than a fact about any document or pane, and a
 * three-pane arrangement with each strip drawn a different way would not be flexible so much as
 * inconsistent. The same reasoning `panel-state.ts` gives for the item-settings panel applies here
 * a second time: it describes the screen, so it is remembered the way the screen is, not the way
 * an open document is.
 *
 * **Persisted, unlike the tab lists themselves.** `tab-store.ts` is deliberately session-local -
 * the *documents* open in a pane are a working set, not worth carrying forward - but *how the
 * strip is drawn* is closer to the theme than to that: chosen once and expected to still be true
 * next time, which is exactly what `theme-store.ts`'s own reasoning is for storing a preference
 * rather than a resolved value.
 *
 * A Zustand slice rather than a bare read at each call site, because more than one pane's strip
 * reads this at once and a toggle in one has to repaint every other pane's strip in the same
 * render pass - the same reason `session-store.ts` is a slice and not a module-level variable.
