/**
 * Which documents are open in each pane's tab strip, held in memory rather than the address.
 *
 * **Not the address, on purpose.** Every other multi-document fact in this shell - which panes are
 * open, their split, their sizes - lives in the URL, `pane-state.ts` argues, so a link somebody
 * pastes reproduces exactly what they saw. A tab strip several documents deep does not have that
 * property to protect: it is a working set, closer to a browser's own tab strip than to a fact
 * worth sending someone. Encoding it into the query string would also mean every preview-tab
 * replacement and every reorder became a navigation entry, which Back does not agree is what
 * happened. So this is the next rung down the state ladder - a Zustand slice, mirrored into
 * `sessionStorage` so a reload (including the PWA's own "Update Nix" button, which reloads the
 * page) or iOS reclaiming a backgrounded tab does not wipe a person's working set - and
 * `pane.itemId` from `usePanes()` stays the one thing that is still in the address: "what a pane
 * shows" is shareable, "what else is open behind it" is not.
 *
 * **What is stored, and what is not.** Only item ids and the pinned flag - never a title, a body,
 * or anything that decides what a person may see. Core still decides that on every load; a
 * restored tab whose item has since been deleted or gone out of reach is left to the normal item
 * loading path to show "not found" the same way a pasted link to it would. Storage is `sessionStorage`,
 * not `localStorage`: a working set is tab-scoped the same way an unfinished flow is, and keyed by
 * workspace so switching workspaces never shows another workspace's tabs. Storage is read back
 * through Zod - a corrupt or older-shaped payload is treated as absent rather than thrown.
 *
 * **No `activeId` field.** The active tab for a pane is `pane.itemId`, exactly as it is today.
 * Keeping a second copy here would hand this store and the URL two answers to the same question,
 * which is the drift `pane-state.ts`'s own doc comments are careful to avoid everywhere else. This
 * store only answers "what's in the strip" - the caller compares each tab's `itemId` against the
 * pane's own `itemId` to know which one is showing.
 *
 * Actions are named as events, matching `session-store.ts`.
