/**
 * Whether the note editor underlines item titles written in the text but not linked: a
 * browser-local preference, like the page guides.
 *
 * **On by default.** An underline writes nothing: the note, the shared document and every
 * collaborator are untouched until somebody chooses "Link to ..." on one. What it costs is a
 * dotted line and a request after a pause in typing - and the person who finds that noisy can
 * switch it off once. Compare the phrase suggestions, which are off by default because their
 * accept key can write into the note by accident; nothing here can. Only the alternative is
 * stored, so the default stays forward-compatible.
