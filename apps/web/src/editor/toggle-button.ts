/**
 * How a toggle presents to a keyboard and a screen reader: the disclosure control, and the
 * heading semantics of a toggle heading's summary.
 *
 * The details extension renders each toggle through a node view and hands `renderToggleButton`
 * the button it created, outside React's tree - so this is DOM work by necessity, not choice.
 * It lives in its own file rather than inline in `note-editor.tsx` because it carries behaviour
 * worth testing on its own: a toggle starts closed and its body carries `hidden`, so a button
 * a keyboard cannot reach or operate means content a keyboard-only reader cannot open at all.
 *
 * Two things the vendor default gets wrong for this product. It draws no icon at all, leaving
 * the slot to be filled by a text glyph - which is what the icon rule exists to prevent, and
 * which would not match the Lucide chevrons used everywhere else in the editor. And it names
 * every button "Expand details content" or "Collapse details content", so a document with six
 * toggles announces six identical controls - and each renames itself as it toggles, where the
 * disclosure pattern wants a constant name and `aria-expanded` carrying the state.
