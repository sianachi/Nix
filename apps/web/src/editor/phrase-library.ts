/**
 * What the phrase suggestions have learned from notes other than the one being written: one small
 * n-gram model per body, held in memory for this page's lifetime and never written anywhere.
 *
 * **Two ways in, both through the body cache's own rules.** A note closed in this session hands
 * over its text if its editor was allowed to keep a local copy (`learnBody`) - the same permission
 * the body cache asks for, so a password-locked body is never learned, even while unlocked. And on
 * idle, copies the cache already holds for this workspace are decoded and learned
 * (`warmPhraseLibrary`), read through `readBodyCache` with every check it applies: the right
 * person, not sealed, within age and size.
 *
 * **Forgetting follows the cache exactly.** A model per body, rather than one merged model,
 * because counts cannot be un-summed: when the cache forgets a body - revoked, locked, its
 * workspace gone, sign-out - this drops that body's model and nothing else has to be recomputed.
 * The cache announces every forgetting (`onBodyForgetting`) before touching the disk, so memory is
 * cleared even if IndexedDB refuses.
 *
 * **One workspace at a time.** Models are offered only to editors in the workspace and for the
 * person they were learned in. A phrase from one workspace's notes never appears as a suggestion
 * in another - the same separation the frecency namespaces keep.
 *
 * **Decoding without the editor.** A cached copy is a Yjs update. Applying it to a bare `Y.Doc`
 * and reading the text out of the XML fragment needs no ProseMirror schema and no editor, and is
 * bounded below by `MAX_DECODE_BYTES` and one body per idle callback.
