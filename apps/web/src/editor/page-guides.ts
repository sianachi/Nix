/**
 * Where the pages fall: the arithmetic behind the page guides, with no DOM in it.
 *
 * **What a guide is.** A note has no pages; the PDF and Word exports do. A guide is a line drawn
 * across the editor where the export would start a new page, so somebody writing to a page count
 * sees the boundary while writing rather than after exporting. It is an estimate, and it says so
 * in the interface: the editor's measure and typeface are not the page's, and only a layout pass
 * with the export's own fonts could say exactly which word lands first on page three.
 *
 * **How the estimate is made.** The export page is A4 with fixed margins and a fixed body size.
 * The exporter that ships is the Go one (`apps/go-workers/internal/exporter/pdf.go`); its numbers
 * are mirrored here and a test keeps them in agreement, because a browser bundle cannot read a Go
 * constant. (`packages/pdf-export` is an earlier TypeScript renderer nothing imports; its
 * different margins are not the ones a person's PDF has.) Zoom that page until its body
 * type is the size of the editor's, and the page becomes a rectangle in editor pixels. Text is
 * roughly an area: the same words fill the same number of square pixels whether the column is
 * wide or narrow. So a page's worth of editor column is that rectangle's area divided by the
 * column's width, corrected for the editor's looser leading. Measured against a real export this
 * lands within about ten percent, which is what "estimated" means on the label.
 *
 * **Where a boundary snaps.** A page does not end mid-line. A text block that crosses the
 * boundary is cut on its own line grid, so the guide sits between two lines rather than through
 * one; a block that cannot be cut - an image, a rule, a linked item - moves whole onto the next
 * page, as the exporters' own layout would. A hard page break is a boundary the writer already
 * chose: the count restarts under it and no guide is drawn over it, since the block draws itself.
