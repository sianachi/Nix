/**
 * Item titles written in a note but not linked, underlined - and one keystroke from becoming a link.
 *
 * **Decorations, never content.** The underline is an inline decoration: drawn over text the
 * person wrote, absent from the document, the Yjs fragment, the body cache and every export.
 * Nothing changes until somebody chooses "Link to ..." (the bubble, or Alt+Enter with the caret
 * in the phrase), and then the phrase becomes a `reference` node in one transaction - the same
 * node the picker inserts - and the pick is remembered as the picker's would be.
 *
 * **What is asked, and when.** The server's `findMentions` reads text and names the readable
 * items in this workspace whose titles appear in it. It has its own per-address rate limit, so it
 * is asked:
 *
 * - once the note has content, for its first `MAX_REQUEST_CHARS` of prose (the part on screen when
 *   a note opens), and after that
 * - for the blocks this person changed, after `IDLE_MS` without a local edit, never more often
 *   than `MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, one request at a time, all changed blocks batched into one request.
 *
 * Each block's answer is cached by its exact text, so a block typed back to something already
 * asked about costs nothing. Nothing is asked while the editor is read-only, offline, composing
 * with an IME, or with the preference off. A colleague's edits do not trigger a request: their
 * client asks for their own changes. Later blocks of a long note are underlined as they are
 * edited, not on open - a deliberate bound on how much of the rate limit opening a note can spend.
 * Blocks past one request's text limit stay queued for the next request rather than being dropped.
 *
 * **A partial answer is not cached.** When the server says its answer was `truncated`, it may not
 * have looked at every block that was sent, so none of them is cached; each is asked about again
 * on its own, one block per request. A block that is truncated alone is drawn from what came back
 * and left uncached, so its next edit asks again.
 *
 * **A refusal is waited out.** A 429 pauses every lookup for the `Retry-After` the server sent
 * (`RATE_LIMIT_PAUSE_MS` when it sent none), and the refused blocks are queued again.
 *
 * **Stale answers are dropped.** A request records where its blocks were and what they said; those
 * positions are mapped through every transaction while it is in flight, and when the answer lands
 * a block whose text has changed since is not decorated from it. An underline already drawn is
 * mapped with the document and removed the moment its text stops being the text it matched.
 *
 * **What is never underlined.** Code blocks and inline code, the labels of existing references,
 * the note itself, items this note already links to, items this person said not to suggest in this
 * workspace (`dismissMention`), and items in other workspaces - a link to those stays one `[[`
 * away, and offering them unasked would underline every common word some other workspace happens
 * to use as a title. The server does that filtering: each request names the workspace and sends
 * the note, its link targets and the dismissed items as `excludeIds` (at most
 * `MAX_EXCLUDED_IDS`), so no result slot is spent on them. What the client still filters is only
 * what the server cannot know: links made in this note after the request left, and an answer
 * served from the cache, which was fetched before the newest link or dismissal.
 *
 * **Keyboard and screen readers.** Decorations cannot take focus, so the affordance is the caret:
 * with it inside an underlined phrase, Alt+Enter links it, and `MentionBubble` shows a "Link to"
 * button after the editor in the tab order and announces once that the phrase names an item.
