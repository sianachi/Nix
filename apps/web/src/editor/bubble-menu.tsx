/**
 * The selection bubble menu: a small toolbar that appears over selected text.
 *
 * It carries the two colour axes - the ink and the wash behind it - because colour is the one
 * formatting decision with no keyboard shortcut and no input rule; everything else the main
 * toolbar offers is reachable without leaving the keys. More groups earn their place here by
 * the same argument, one at a time.
 *
 * **The same shape as the slash menu, deliberately.** The document's selection is the source of
 * truth, read back out of the editor on every transaction - and on scroll and resize too,
 * because the box is placed in viewport coordinates against text that moves without a
 * transaction: the editor scrolls inside its own overflow container. Focus stays in the editor
 * for pointer users (mousedown on the menu is swallowed before it can blur the text); keyboard
 * users Tab to it, because the menu sits after the editable region in the DOM. It costs one tab
 * stop, not six: `role="toolbar"` promises arrow-key navigation, so the focus roves between the
 * buttons rather than the Tab key walking them - across both groups, because a toolbar is one
 * widget however many groups it holds, and a second tab stop would be a second widget.
 *
 * The vendor's bubble-menu plugin was configured but never given an element - it draws nothing
 * without one - and wiring it up would have bought floating-ui positioning at the price of a
 * second show/hide model to keep in step with this file's own.
 *
 * **The colours are token roles, not values.** Each button applies a name from the schema's
 * closed set; what the name looks like is decided by `prose.ts` against the design tokens at
 * render, which is what keeps a stored document legible on both grounds. `default` clears the
 * mark rather than writing a literal "ordinary text" colour into the document - the command in
 * `@nix/editor-schema` owns that rule.
