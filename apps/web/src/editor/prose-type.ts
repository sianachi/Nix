/**
 * The document's type scale, stated once.
 *
 * **Why this is a module and not `<Text>`.** ProseMirror owns the document's DOM. React never sees
 * a heading, a paragraph or a code block to put a component around - `note-editor.tsx` hands each
 * node's class *string* to its extension as `HTMLAttributes.class` and TipTap merges it into the
 * element it renders. So the one place in the product where the type scale cannot go through the
 * typography primitive is also the place with the most typography in it, and the fallback has to be
 * the next best thing: the steps named here, in one table, rather than spelled out at each of the
 * eight sites in `prose.ts` that need them.
 *
 * That matters because two of those sites are supposed to agree and had no way of saying so. A
 * toggle presenting as a heading is meant to match the real heading of the same rank; before this
 * module the only thing holding the two tables together was a comment in `prose.ts` asking the next
 * editor to keep them in step. Now the sizes sit next to each other and a mismatch is visible in
 * one screenful.
 *
 * **Why the toggle steps are spelled out again rather than composed.** Tailwind v4 finds classes by
 * scanning source text, so a variant-prefixed class has to appear complete somewhere in the source:
 * `` `[&_[data-toggle-level="1"]_summary]:${DOCUMENT_HEADING_STEP[1]}` `` compiles to nothing at
 * all, silently, and the toggle renders at body size with no error anywhere. The prefixed spellings
 * below are therefore literals, kept immediately under the table they have to match - which is the
 * closest a scanner-driven toolchain lets us get to stating the relationship once. `specimens.ts`
 * records the same constraint for the same reason.
 *
 * Unprefixed steps compose freely: `text-md` appears literally in this file, so Tailwind emits it
 * however `prose.ts` goes on to concatenate it.
