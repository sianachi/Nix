/**
 * Phrase suggestions drawn as muted text at the caret, accepted with Right Arrow.
 *
 * **A decoration, never content.** The suggestion is a ProseMirror widget: it is drawn into the
 * page and is not in the document, so it never reaches the Yjs fragment, never syncs to a
 * colleague, never lands in the body cache or an export, and undo knows nothing of it. Only
 * accepting it writes anything, and that write is plain text inserted by an ordinary transaction -
 * exactly what typing the same characters would have produced.
 *
 * **When one is drawn.** After `IDLE_MS` without a local edit, at the end of a text block, in the
 * middle of a word or right after a space, and only when the model is confident (`ngram.ts` holds
 * the thresholds). Never in a code block or inline code, never while the `[[`/`@` or `/` pickers
 * have a trigger open, never in a read-only editor, in Vim Normal or Visual mode or during an IME
 * composition, and never after anything but typing - moving the caret, pasting, undoing or a
 * colleague's edit does not summon one. Any further edit, caret move or blur removes it.
 *
 * **Why Right Arrow, and only at the end of a block.** Tab is taken: it indents list items and
 * moves between table cells, and outside those it is how a keyboard leaves the editor - claiming
 * it, even only while a suggestion shows, would make Tab mean three things depending on a muted
 * glyph. Emacs basics binds the Ctrl and Alt movement, kill and yank chords, so no control chord
 * is free either. Right Arrow at the
 * very end of a block has one native meaning - step into the next block - and a suggestion is only
 * drawn there right after typing, which is the moment that step is least likely. That is the same
 * gesture shells and mail clients use for a completion. Vim Normal mode never shows a suggestion,
 * so its own `l` and arrow handling is untouched; in Insert mode Right Arrow accepts like anywhere
 * else.
 *
 * **Escape dismisses.** It is consumed (the innermost layer wins, as the pickers do) unless Vim is
 * on, where Escape also has to reach Vim to return to Normal mode - and Normal mode removes the
 * suggestion anyway.
 *
 * **What it learns from, and what it keeps.** This document's own text, rebuilt at most every
 * `REBUILD_MS` while writing, and the session's phrase library (`phrase-library.ts`) for the same
 * person and workspace. All in memory. When the editor closes, its text is handed to the library
 * only if the editor was allowed to keep a local copy of the body - the same rule the body cache
 * applies, so a locked body is never learned.
 *
 * **Not colour alone.** The ghost is muted, italic, and followed by a small Right Arrow keycap, so
 * it reads as "not yet written, and here is the key" without relying on the muted colour.
 *
 * **Screen readers.** The widget (keycap included) is `aria-hidden` and not editable, so it is
 * never read as part of the note; accepting one is announced through the shared live region as
 * "Inserted suggestion: ... Undo to remove.", so what was inserted, and how to take it back, is
 * heard.
 *
 * **Touch screens.** On a coarse pointer nothing is suggested until a hardware keyboard shows
 * itself by pressing a key an on-screen keyboard does not have (an arrow, Escape or Tab): without
 * one there is no Right Arrow to accept with, and a ghost nobody can accept is only noise.
 *
 * **Bounded learning.** The document's own model reads a window of at most `DOCUMENT_CHARS`
 * around the caret, and after the first build it is rebuilt in an idle callback, never inside the
 * pause that decides whether to draw a suggestion.
