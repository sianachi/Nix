/**
 * A principal's own set of reusable native canvas shapes, from `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/me/canvas-library`.
 *
 * **Per user, not per item or per workspace.** The library is a personal drawing tool - the shapes
 * somebody has curated follow them into every canvas they open, the same
 * way a physical stencil is not left behind in one notebook. That is why this hook takes no
 * `itemId`: it asks Core for the caller's own library, the same request wherever a canvas mounts.
 *
 * **`items` is a seed, not live state.** It changes exactly once, when the mount-time read
 * resolves, and `save` deliberately does not mirror what it was handed back into it. The editor
 * owns the live library; mirroring it here gave every save a state change, and a state change
 * re-armed the editor's seeding effect, whose `updateLibrary` echoed back through
 * `onLibraryChange` into another save - a feedback loop that hammered Core with identical PUTs
 * and hung the tab.
 *
 * Uses the configured `NixClient` so the personal library shares the application's authentication,
 * cancellation, error mapping and response parsing path.
