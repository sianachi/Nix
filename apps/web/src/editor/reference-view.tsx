/**
 * How a reference is drawn once the server has been asked about it.
 *
 * The four states of {@link useReference}, and each one is a different sentence:
 *
 * - **resolved** - the item's title as it is now, and a control that opens it. Not the stored
 *   label, so renaming the target is reflected everywhere it is mentioned.
 * - **loading** - the stored label, which is exactly what it was cached for.
 * - **refused** - a stub, and never the label.
 * - **unavailable** - the stored label again, and a note saying it could not be checked. A failed
 *   lookup is a fact about the network; drawing it as a refusal would tell the reader something
 *   about their own permissions that nobody established.
 *
 * **What the refused stub is and is not worth.** The label is already in the reader's hands: it
 * travels inside the document, the CRDT delivered it, and `@nix/editor-schema`'s own `renderHTML`
 * puts it on the page for every consumer that cannot ask anybody anything - the collaboration
 * service, an export. So refusing to draw it here does not keep a secret from somebody determined
 * to read the update log; it keeps a *stale, unverified* title out of the interface, and stops the
 * product presenting it as though it were current. That is a smaller claim than "the label is
 * confidential", and it is the true one - which is why `loading` and `unavailable` may show it and
 * `refused` may not: those two mean "not checked yet", and this one means "checked, and it is not
 * yours". Anything stronger needs the label out of the document, which is a schema change and a
 * different goal.
 *
 * A person mentioned with `@` gets the label and no navigation: a principal is not somewhere the
 * item panes can open, and there is no people surface for it to lead to yet.

            cannot reach and a touch device cannot hover.

            And it names all three possibilities, because the server deliberately reports one
            answer for them: deleted, never existed, and not shared with you. Saying "you do not
            have access" - as this did - picks the most alarming of the three and states it as
