 * entitled to.** It is written when the link is made, from the title the author could see. A
 * reader who cannot open the target must therefore never be shown it - which means resolution is
 * not a nicety that keeps titles fresh, it is the thing that decides whether a title may be
 * displayed at all. That is why the four states below are four and not two.
 *
 * The server refuses to say *why* an identifier did not resolve - deleted, never existed, and not
 * visible to you are one answer - so `refused` covers all three. `unavailable` is different in
 * kind: it means nobody has answered yet, which is a statement about the network and not about
 * the reader's permission, and it must not be drawn as a refusal.
