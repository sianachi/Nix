 * that was defined nowhere, and Tailwind's reset strips heading sizes, list markers, blockquote
 * indents and table borders. Every block in a note rendered as identical plain text, so the rich
 * editor did not look plain - it looked broken.
 *
 * A class string cannot be tested by rendering it, so what is asserted here is what can go wrong
 * without anybody noticing: a node the schema defines with no appearance at all, and an arbitrary
 * value creeping back in. The second is the whole point of the phase these were written in, and a
 * regex sweep is a better guard than any number of examples.
