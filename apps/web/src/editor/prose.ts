/**
 * The document's typography, as class strings.
 *
 * **Why this file exists.** Tailwind's preflight resets the browser's default typography to
 * nothing: no heading sizes, no list markers, no quote indent, no table borders. A rich document
 * rendered under it is a column of identical plain text, and the editor looks broken when in fact
 * only its clothes are missing. These strings are the clothes.
 *
 * **Why class strings and not a stylesheet.** The repository allows exactly two `.css` files - the
 * Tailwind entry and the design-token sheet - so there is nowhere to put a `.prose h1 { ... }` rule
 * and no wish for one. The upside is that the styles are ordinary source: greppable, diffable, and
 * checked by a test rather than by eye.
 *
 * **Why here and not in `@nix/editor-schema`.** The collaboration service builds the same
 * extension list in Node to check that an accepted update still parses. It renders nothing, and a
 * presentation concern in that package would be a concern it has to carry into a process that has
 * no DOM. The schema says what a document may contain; this file says what it looks like.
 *
 * **How they reach the document.** ProseMirror renders the document, so React never sees a heading
 * to put a `className` on. `note-editor.tsx` instead hands each string to its extension as
 * `HTMLAttributes.class`, which TipTap merges into that node's rendered element - see the mapping
 * there.
 *
 * **No arbitrary values, anywhere.** Every size is a step on the token sheet's type or spacing
 * scale and every colour is a role or a ramp step. One hard-coded length here is how a type scale
 * quietly stops being one, so `prose.test.ts` sweeps this file for them rather than trusting
 * review to notice.

  // three ways a run of text can be lit in this product agree. `neutral-300` for the muted one
  // rather than `neutral-200`: a grey wash has no hue to be found by, and `neutral-200` sits
  // within 1.02:1 of the surface a document is written on, so it would be a highlight nobody

  // accent wash. Naming the steps directly keeps the foreground choice visible over a highlight
  // instead of silently ignored, which is what a control that offers both axes owes the person
