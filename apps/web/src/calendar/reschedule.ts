 * What to write when an entry is dragged somewhere else.
 *
 * **Rescheduling is answerable from the entry alone.** Each entry carries the key its own container
 * placed it by, so moving it writes that key on that item and nothing has to be guessed. Creating
 * used to have no answer here for the same reason in reverse - a brand new item carries no entry to
 * read a key from - but goal 3.10 answers it a different way: `use-workspace-calendar.ts`'s
 * `create` asks the chosen container's own view configuration directly, rather than reading
 * anything off an entry.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock. The target and the reader's zone are both given, so the same drag
 * produces the same value twice and it can be tested without a browser.

 * to Wednesday means nine o'clock on Wednesday - the reader moved it across the grid, not across
 * the clock. Writing the bare day would silently discard the time, which is data the reader never
 * asked to lose and cannot get back from the interface.
 *
 * Returns null when the entry's stored value cannot be read, which is the same condition the view
 * counts as unplaceable. A drop that cannot be expressed is refused rather than written as
