 * on each side covers every lead and trail the grid can produce.
 *
 * The day grain still fetches a day either side. A moment stored in a distant zone can belong to
 * the reader's day while being written with the neighbouring one, and the server windows on the
 * written day - so the extra day is what stops such an entry vanishing at the edge.
