/**
 * Turning collated entries into something the shared grids can draw.
 *
 * **One property key for every entry, invented here.** Both grids take a single `dateProperty` and
 * read it off each item, because a container has exactly one. The collated calendar does not: its
 * entries were placed by whatever their own container names, and the dev workspace alone uses four
 * different keys. Rewriting each entry onto one synthetic key is what lets the grids stay untouched
 * - the alternative was widening them to resolve a key per item, which would put the container
 * calendar's whole suite in the blast radius for a view it does not have.
 *
 * The key is not a real property and is never written back. It exists between this module and the
 * grid, for one render.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock or a zone; it is a rewrite of values that already exist.

 * The key the grids read.
 *
 * Prefixed and unlikely to collide with a real property, because it shares a namespace with them
 * inside the synthetic item below. A container that genuinely declared a property called

 * into the schema editor by accident.

 * **A view model wearing `Item`'s shape.** The grids read exactly
 * three things off an item - `id`, `properties.title`, and `properties[dateProperty]` - and the
 * calendar response carries all three. It does not carry a workspace identifier, a sequence, or
 * the timestamps `Item` also declares, and inventing them would put facts on screen this response
 * never returned. So the unread fields are filled with the empty value of their type.
 *
 * If a grid ever starts reading a fourth field, this is where it will be wrong, and it will be
 * wrong quietly - which is why the three are named here rather than left to be rediscovered.
 *
 * No cast is needed: `Item`'s identifier and timestamp fields are typed as plain strings, since Zod
 * infers `string` from `z.uuid()` and `z.iso.datetime()`. The compiler will not catch a placeholder
 * here, which is precisely why the placeholders are named above.
