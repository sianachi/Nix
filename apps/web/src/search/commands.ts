 * What the palette can do, as opposed to what it can find.

 * as one of the closed set of extension points a plugin may use. A plugin contributing a command
 * has to be able to hand over exactly this shape; writing the commands as an array a component
 * closes over would mean discovering that later and rewriting the palette to accept them.
 *
 * `keywords` exist for the same reason the slash menu's do: people type the word they know rather
 * than the word the interface uses. Somebody looking for the sidebar types "hide", "collapse" or
 * "sidebar", and all three have to find it.
