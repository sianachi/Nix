/**
 * Planning an import: what the chosen files would become, before anything is created.
 *
 * The plan is the preview - MVP-7's 7.5 asks for exactly this order: what will be mapped, what
 * will be dropped, said *before* commit rather than discovered after. Every chosen file lands in
 * exactly one place: a planned note or attachment, a skipped row with its reason (inside a hidden
 * directory), or a failed row (a body the document model rejects). Front matter becomes
 * properties by the same shared rule the CLI applies (`@nix/markdown/front-matter`), and the
 * inbound changes (wiki links, embeds, and image fallbacks) come from the same parser that produced
 * the validated body, so the web and CLI cannot disagree about what a file becomes.
 *
 * Everything is planned under one root container - the picked folder's name, or a plain "Imported
 * notes" for loose files - so the whole import has a single handle: one item to open, and one item
 * to delete to undo it.
