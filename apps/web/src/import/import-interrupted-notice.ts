 * **Counts only, and only for the person who ran it.** No item title, path, or body ever crosses
 * into storage here, and the record carries the issuer's subject: a session expiring mid-import is
 * exactly the moment identity is uncertain, and someone else signing in next on a shared machine -
 * even a co-member of the same workspace - must not be shown another person's import. A deliberate
 * sign-out clears it outright (see `clearInterruptedImport`).
 *
 * Lives in `import/` rather than `lib/` because the shape - what an interrupted *import* looked
 * like - belongs to this feature; only the storage accessor itself is a shared leaf.
