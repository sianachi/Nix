 * address is redirected: an item, a destination, any query (a launch from a share sheet or a
 * shortcut carries one) or navigation state (the Search shortcut's) is somewhere the person asked
 * to be, and a launch address is not the bare index at all, so a launch intent always wins. Because
 * a deep link also marks the session, coming back to the workspace index later in it is never
 * taken for a start.
 *

 * index that would send the person on again.
