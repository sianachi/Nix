/**
 * The route tree and the crash barrier that wraps it.
 *
 * react-router is used in declarative mode: routes are JSX, and there are no
 * loaders, because nothing in this app fetches yet. When the api-client lands,
 * the tree moves to data mode and this file is where that happens - callers
 * only ever see <App />.
 *
 * The error boundary sits inside the router on purpose. A crash in a page
 * leaves the router mounted, so recovery re-renders the current route instead
 * of reloading the document and losing the URL state.
 *
 * <App /> expects a router above it. main.tsx supplies BrowserRouter; tests
 * supply MemoryRouter, which is what makes the URL-state convention testable
 * without a browser.
 *
 * The outer element carries the token-backed page defaults - the ground, the ink
 * and the body face - so they survive even when a crash replaces the whole route
 * tree with the error fallback.
 *
 * `min-h-dvh` is part of that promise rather than layout left over from an older
 * shell. Nothing sets a background on html or body, so this element is the only
 * thing painting the page, and the error fallback has no height of its own:
 * without a minimum, an app-level crash paints a ground the height of its own
 * error message and leaves the rest of the window browser-white - which on the
 * dark ground is a dark card on a white sheet. It does not fight the shell's
 * `h-dvh` either, because a minimum on the parent still leaves the child's
 * height definite.
