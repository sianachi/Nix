/**
 * The navigation rail: the handful of ways to look at the whole workspace at once.
 *
 * A workspace tree answers "which note", one at a time. Calendar, Graph and Bookmarks each answer
 * a different question about every note together - which is why none of them is an item in the
 * tree, and why they need a destination of their own rather than a row inside it. Notes sits beside
 * them as the tree's own destination, so the upper group names a complete set of ways into the
 * workspace rather than three extras bolted beside an unlabelled default. Import and Settings sit
 * at the foot: persistent workspace operations rather than views. Desktop keeps a strip beside
 * the tree; compact layouts use one destination menu inside the workspace drawer.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in the app and not in `packages/ui`
 *
 * `<Nav>` (packages/ui/src/controls/Nav.tsx) is already the design system's "a list of links, one
 * of which may be the page you are on", and this is deliberately not it. Two things differ, and
 * both are product facts rather than design-system ones. `<Nav>` requires a visible label per item
 * - correctly, for a settings sidebar - while the desktop rail is icon-only beside the tree,
 * carrying its name for assistive technology alone. The compact menu provides visible labels
 * and saves drawer width. And a rail is one tab stop
 * with the arrow keys moving inside it, which `<Nav>` does not do and should not learn for a single
 * caller. What is left after those two is a component that knows this application's own destinations
 * and imports this application's router, neither of which belongs in a package that `apps/*` depend
 * on.
 *
 * ## Keyboard: one tab stop, arrows inside
 *
 * The APG's roving tabindex, the same convention `views/calendar/use-roving-grid.ts` implements for the
 * hour grid, and for the same reason: a set of like controls should cost one Tab press to pass,
 * not one per control. Seven controls make that a real saving today and a correct habit regardless
 * - the rail is where persistent workspace controls accumulate.
 *
 * It is spelled out here rather than reusing that hook, which is built for a grid whose slots the
 * caller does not render (it finds buttons by `querySelector` and writes `tabindex` onto the DOM,
 * precisely because `CreateItemControl` exposes no tabindex prop). This component renders its own
 * links and button, so the entry point is a prop it passes, not an attribute it has to reach into
 * the DOM to set. Down/Up move by one and Home/End jump to the ends, all clamped rather than
 * wrapped - the same no-wrap choice the grid makes, so the ends of a keyboard-navigable set are
 * findable by feel everywhere in the product.
 *
 * ## Where you are is never colour alone
 *
 * The current destination carries `aria-current="page"`, which is the only signal that reaches
 * somebody who cannot see the accent wash. Same contract, and same reasoning, as `<Nav>`'s.
