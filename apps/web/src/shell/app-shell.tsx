/**
 * The application chrome: one workspace, always visible.
 *
 * **There is no tab strip, and that is the point.** Tabs were a faithful reading of the design
 * file's five example screens and the wrong shape for the product: they made a board and a search
 * page into destinations, which they are not. A board is a way of looking at a container, and
 * searching is something you do while reading rather than instead of it. So the shell is a
 * persistent tree beside whatever is open, a search affordance that opens over the top, and a
 * profile menu holding what belongs to the person rather than to the document.
 *
 * The tree lives here rather than on the editor screen because it is how you move around; a tree
 * that appeared on one screen would make every other screen a dead end.
 *
 * ## The shell owns the viewport
 *
 * Exactly one element is `h-dvh`, exactly one element clips, and each pane owns exactly one
 * scroller. **Vertical belongs to the pane. Horizontal belongs to the view**, because only the view
 * knows what its wide axis is - a board scrolls through columns, a table through property columns,
 * and the pane cannot know which.
 *
 * That division is a convention the views keep, not something the CSS enforces. A pane's
 * `overflow-y-auto` makes it a scroll container on *both* axes - per CSS Overflow 3, one axis
 * leaving `visible` takes the other with it - so what actually keeps the horizontal axis quiet is
 * that every wide view brings its own `overflow-x-auto` and `min-w-0` lets the pane shrink to fit
 * around it. See `paneScroller` in `../layout/regions`.
 *
 * This was previously unimplemented rather than mis-tuned, and it failed in two directions at once.
 * The root was `min-h-dvh`, so `flex-1` never had a definite height and no descendant's
 * `overflow-auto` ever had anything to scroll - every pane grew instead, and the page scrolled.
 * And nothing anywhere clipped: `min-w-0` lets a box shrink but does not stop a descendant painting
 * outside it, so a wide table pushed the *document* into horizontal scroll. Scrolling right then
 * slid the whole page, carrying the fixed sidebar off-screen while view content took the pixels it
 * had been holding - which read as content overflowing into the tree.
 *
 * **No view owns its own vertical axis today, and the one that looks like it does, does not.** The
 * calendar's hour grid carries an `overflow-y-auto` (`calendar-hours.tsx`), but the `Blueprint`
 * above it has no definite height, so the grid's 24 rows size that element instead of scrolling
 * inside it and the pane ends up carrying the whole thing. There are not two vertical scrollers
 * competing - there is one, and it is the pane's. Nothing is unreachable, so this is left alone
 * rather than restructured from the shell; a view that genuinely wants its own vertical axis would
 * need a definite height first, and that is a decision for the view.

          Every box property is re-applied under `focus:`, which looks redundant and is not:
          `.focus\:not-sr-only:focus` sets `padding: 0` at two-class specificity, so a plain `px-4`

          top and left of its focus ring outside the window, which is the one thing a focus

          The full stacking ladder, lowest to highest: pane content and the drawer's own scrim
          (`z-0`) < the drawer panel (`z-10`) < the profile menu (`z-20`) < the delete-undo toast
          (`z-[25]`, below) < the search overlay (`z-30`, `aria-modal="true"`) < this skip link
          (`z-50`). The drawer's own pair sit inside the pane row beside `<main>`, not inside
          `<main>` itself, but `<main>` carries `isolate` (below) precisely so nothing inside a pane
          - `sheet-grid.tsx`'s own `z-20`/`z-30`/`z-40` layers, or its drag overlay - can climb into
          the root context and outrank the header's popovers the way the drawer used to before it
          got its own numbers put in their place.

          The toast sits *below* the search overlay rather than above it, which used to be
          backwards: an earlier version of this comment argued the toast should outrank search
          because its undo window is time-limited, but the overlay it would have outranked is
          `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"` - telling assistive technology that everything outside
          it, the toast included, is unavailable for as long as it is open. A toast that visually
          sat on top of that while being declared unreachable by the platform's own modality
          contract was the contradiction, not the ordering. The honest trade-off this ladder now
          encodes: opening search while a toast is showing costs the toast's visibility for as long
          as search stays open, exactly as it costs every other item behind the dialog - the timer
          underneath keeps running regardless, so a long search session can still let the window
          close unseen, which is the correct read of "unavailable while the dialog is open" rather
          than a difference this ordering tries to paper over. `z-50` clears all of them, being the
          one control that must never be covered. */}

                `inert` while the drawer is open: the native (React 19) way of making this region
                genuinely unreachable to pointer and assistive technology without a hand-rolled focus
                trap standing in for it - see `sidebar-drawer.tsx`'s own comment on why that trade was
                made. Scoped to the drawer being open rather than to `narrow` alone, since a narrow
                window with the drawer closed has nothing covering this region at all.

                `isolate` unconditionally, not only while the drawer is open: it creates a stacking
                context for everything a pane renders, so nothing in here - `sheet-grid.tsx`'s own
                `z-20`/`z-30`/`z-40` layers, or its drag overlay - can ever resolve into the *root*
                stacking context and paint over the header's own popovers. This is a different fix
                from the drawer's: the drawer sits *beside* `<main>`, not inside it, so `isolate` here
                does nothing for the drawer's own stacking - that was corrected separately, by giving
                the drawer numbers low enough to lose to the header outright (see the skip link's
                comment above for the full ladder). `isolation: isolate` does not change the containing
                block for `position: fixed`, so a fixed drag overlay still covers the viewport
                geometrically - this only stops it from painting above chrome that lives outside
