// Vite + Vitest configuration for @nix/web.
//
// Tailwind CSS v4 is CSS-first: there is no tailwind.config.js and no
// PostCSS chain. The @tailwindcss/vite plugin compiles src/app.css, which
// imports Tailwind and then the @nix/design-tokens @theme sheet, so every
// Industry token becomes a utility class.
//
// Content detection is automatic for this app's own source, but not sufficient
// on its own - see the @source directive in src/app.css, which says why.
//
// The test block runs the same source through jsdom. CSS is not processed
// during tests - component tests assert behaviour and roles, never computed
// styles, so compiling Tailwind for them would only cost time.
