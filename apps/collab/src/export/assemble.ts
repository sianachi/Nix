 * that holds a connection for minutes and a Core that spends the whole time answering it. The cap
 * is stated in the archive rather than silently applied: what was left out appears in `omitted`
 * with `limit-reached`, so a truncated export cannot be mistaken for a complete one.
 *
 * The fix when a workspace-sized export is wanted is MVP-6.5's E9 shape - a job, object storage and
