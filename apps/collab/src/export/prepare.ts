 * Everything an export needs, gathered once and shared by every format.

 * **The traversal has two consumers and only the sink differs.** `.nix` pipes what this returns
 * into `writeArchive`; the bundles endpoint pipes it into NDJSON for the Go export worker to convert.
 * Walking the tree twice, or letting each route assemble its own manifest, is how the two would
 * start disagreeing about what an export contains - and the manifest is the thing both an archive
 * reader and an import report are read against.
 *
 * The bundles generator is returned unstarted. Enumerating the tree and gathering schemas is
 * metadata-only and bounded by `EXPORT_LIMITS`; reading bodies is neither, and keeping it lazy is
 * what holds the memory ceiling at one document rather than at the whole subtree.
