/**
 * The service's operational signals, named for the questions they answer.
 *
 * A resident-document server has exactly two ways to die - out of memory, and behind on
 * flushes - and both are visible here before they happen. That is the bar for adding a
 * metric: it must inform eviction tuning, capacity refusal, or an alert someone would act
 * on. Per-document label cardinality is deliberately avoided; totals and distributions
 * answer the operational questions without turning the registry into a second copy of the
 * document table.
