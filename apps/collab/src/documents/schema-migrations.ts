/**
 * How a document's stored schema version is raised.
 *
 * **A pin is a promise, and this is what keeps it.** `content_doc.schema_version` says "no
 * build older than this is needed to open me". When the schema gains a node, every existing
 * document is still perfectly readable - the node set only widens - but its pin is now
 * understating what this build might write into it. Raising the pin is what closes that gap,
 * and until the pin is raised `judgeCandidate` and `checkMergedDocument` refuse to write
 * anything above it. So a document is never in a state where the pin lies: it is either
 * pinned low and held to the old node set, or pinned high and free.
 *
 * **Most migrations rewrite nothing.** Adding optional nodes and marks needs no content
 * change at all, so `rewrite` is absent and the migration is a pin bump with a parse check in
 * front of it.
 *
 * **A document that does not parse is left alone.** Force-bumping it would move a broken
 * document from "openable by an old build, broken on a new one" to "broken everywhere", which
 * is strictly worse and irreversible. It is reported instead, with its identifier, so somebody
 * can look at it.
