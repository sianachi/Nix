 * **The next version is simulated by migrating to `SCHEMA_VERSION + 1`.** At version 1 there
 * is no valid pin below the current one - a document pinned at 0 could not legitimately hold
 * a version-1 document, and the pin check correctly refuses to write one into it - so the
 * migrator is exercised in the only direction that exists yet: forward, to a version this
 * build does not itself speak. That is exactly the shape of a real bump, where the job runs
 * with a build newer than the corpus.
 *
 * The complementary claim - that a document pinned *below* the running build stays writable,
 * which is what the original exact-inequality check would have broken - is covered by
 * `schema-migrations.test.ts`, where a stub strategy can report a version the real schema
 * cannot yet produce. It becomes expressible here the moment the node set gains its first
 * version-2 entry.
 *
 * Requires the development stack, like every other `.db.test.ts` here.
