/**
 * The collaboration service's HTTP surface and the WebSocket endpoint it hosts.
 *
 * This file owns the Fastify instance, the socket attachment and shutdown; each route group
 * lives under `routes/`. **Every document route is authorized by Core**, through `establish`
 * in `context.ts`: nothing here decides who may read or write a document; it forwards the
 * caller's token and believes the answer, which keeps one authorization code path in the
 * system. `/healthz` and `/metrics` are open. The internal routes are gated by the service
 * secret (`internalCaller` in `auth.ts`), and those acting for a user also forward their token.
