# Guard: the frontend's dependency direction.
#
# AGENTS.md says "apps/* -> packages/*, never sideways or upward",
# and until this script nothing enforced it. The backend has check-layering.sh;
# the frontend had review. Review is what let apps/web/src/app/ become a folder
# that was a leaf and a root at once - half the application imported its
# vocabulary, and its composition imported half the application - which produced
# a real import cycle:
#
#   app-shell.tsx -> items/workspace-sidebar.tsx -> app/announcer.ts
#
# The tiers below are what replaced that folder. The rules are a direction, not
# a taste, so unlike check-spacing-roles.sh there is no exemption marker for any
# of them: a direction rule with an escape hatch is a suggestion, and the whole
# reason layout/ and shell/ are separate folders is that no file needs one.
#
#   T0 leaf     lib/, a11y/    third-party and their own folder, nothing else
#   T0 leaf     layout/        the above, plus lib/
#   T1 feature  everything else under src/    T0, siblings, shell/ type-only
#   T2 shell    shell/         anything
#   T3 root     app.tsx, main.tsx             anything
#
# The leaf rules compose, and that is the point. layout/ may only reach lib/,
# and lib/ may reach nothing, so there is no path out of the leaf set at all -
# which makes the cycle above unexpressible rather than merely detected. That is
# also why this script does not try to detect cycles directly: a DFS over the
# module graph in bash 3.2 (no associative arrays - see check-spacing-roles.sh's
# own workaround for a far smaller structure) would need path normalisation and
# extension resolution, and would earn its keep only for feature-to-feature
# cycles, which are not the problem observed.
#
# Rules enforced:
#
#   R1  layout/ imports nothing from the application but lib/.
#   R2  a11y/ imports nothing from the application.
#   R3  lib/ imports nothing from the application.
#   R4  nobody outside shell/, app.tsx and main.tsx imports shell/ for a value.
#   R5  apps/web/src/app/ does not exist.
#
# Be clear about what this is worth. It catches the ordinary mistake - someone
# adds `import { announce } from '../a11y/announcer'` to a layout/ file - and
# fails with a file and a line. It does not catch a determined one:
#
#   - Matching is line-oriented, so an import statement folded across lines with
#     `from` on its own is invisible. Prettier's current settings keep every
#     import in apps/web/src on one line; a reformat would silently narrow this
#     script's coverage rather than fail loudly.
#   - R4 cannot tell a genuinely type-only multi-line import from a value one.
#   - `ReturnType<typeof x>` can reach a feature's type through an allowed
#     module without ever naming it.
#
# If "the grep missed one" ever happens, the replacement is a real tool rather
# than a bigger script: eslint-plugin-import's `import/no-cycle` plus
# `no-restricted-imports` zones, which have a TypeScript resolver and see the
# whole graph. That is the same escalation check-layering.sh names for itself.
#
# Scope is apps/web/src. Tests may import whatever they need, so any directory
# named `tests` is pruned - the same call check-text-primitive.sh makes.
#
# Portable across BSD (macOS) and GNU grep: only -r, -n, -E and --include are
# used, and the patterns avoid word-boundary escapes (\b, \<, [[:<:]]) which the
# two implementations spell differently. bash 3.2 compatible.
