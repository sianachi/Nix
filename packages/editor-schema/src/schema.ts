 * The version stored documents are validated against.
 *
 * **Bump this only when the node or mark set changes in a way an older build cannot
 * read.** It is written onto `content_doc.schema_version` and checked by the
 * collaboration service before an update is accepted, so a bump is a commitment to
 * migrate every stored document past it. Adding a block is such a change; changing how
 * one renders is not.
 *
 * **Bumping it is three things, not one** (ADR-0024): raise this number, add every new node
 * and mark to `NODE_MIN_VERSION` / `MARK_MIN_VERSION` in `versions.ts` so a document's own
 * pin is enforced rather than assumed, and run `pnpm --filter @nix/collab migrate-documents`
 * at deploy to raise the stored pins. Between the deploy and that job, documents sit at the
 * old pin and every write is held to the old node set, which is correct and uneventful.
 *
 * Version 2 added composition (columns), collapsible sections, references, the two computed
 * blocks, token-named colour and the comment mark - all at once, because each bump costs a
 * corpus-wide pin rewrite and a lockout window for tabs left open across a deploy.
