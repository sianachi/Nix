/**
 * The commands and the repair half of columns.
 *
 * `columns.ts` defines the two nodes and takes the permissive side of every trade - `column+`
 * rather than `column column+`, `block*` rather than `block+` - so that a CRDT merge can never
 * produce a document that refuses to open. This file is the other half it promised: the commands
 * that create and edit rows, and the `appendTransaction` normaliser that repairs the shapes the
 * schema deliberately lets through.
 *
 * **A separate extension, not part of `nixExtensions`, and in this package rather than in
 * `apps/web` (ADR-0032).** `nixExtensions` is the schema alone, which is what the collaboration
 * service builds to check that an update still parses. This file is editing behaviour - but it
 * is the editing behaviour that keeps a document in a shape the schema *deliberately permits and
 * the product cannot draw*, which is a property of the format, not of the interface over it.
 * `nixEditingExtensions` is the pairing, and `apps/web` adds its own `ColumnControls` on top for
 * everything that needs a browser.
 *
 * **Being DOM-free is a consequence, not the argument.** That these functions run in Node is
 * what makes the collaboration service the plausible future home for the repair: it already
 * builds this schema there, and repairing once server-side would beat repairing on whichever
 * client types next. It does not run it today because it validates rather than edits - no
 * transaction pipeline of its own, no way to broadcast a repair - and because the local-origin
 * gate below is a client's concept. That is the documented swap plan, not a claim that testing
 * in Node justifies the placement.

 * (`unwrap` of a first column, `refill` of the column the caret sits against), and by

 * merges: the schema was made permissive precisely so a concurrent deletion could merge, and
 * this is where the resulting shape is folded back into one the product draws. But a merge is
 * seen by every open client at once, and a repair is an ordinary edit that broadcasts - so
 * repairing on receipt means N clients each append the same fix and each send it. For `widths`
 * that is N redundant writes of the same numbers; for `refill` it is N paragraphs inserted into
 * one empty column, because an insertion is not idempotent. Gating on a local change makes
 * exactly one client repair: the next one to touch the document.
 *
 * What that costs is a window. A malformed row that arrives while nobody is typing stays
 * malformed until somebody types *anywhere in the document* - see the scan note in the plugin
 * for why "anywhere" needs saying, and what it costs to be true. Readable, editable and slightly
 * odd in the meantime, which is the same smaller wrong `columns.ts` chose when it took the
 * permissive side of the schema. The
 * alternative considered and rejected was electing a repairer by lowest client id, which needs
 * awareness state this package cannot see and fails closed when that client is the one that
 * just disconnected.
