/**
 * Columns, in the two tiers a consumer may bind to.
 *
 * The extension is the surface: every column operation is a command on it, so a caller says what
 * it wants and this package decides how. The geometry helpers below it are pure arithmetic over a
 * row, exported because the editor's resize handles need to *report* a width before committing
 * one and there is no transaction to read it from yet.
 *
 * **The `*Tr` transforms are deliberately not here.** They are what the commands are one-line
 * adapters over, and they stay internal - a consumer that bound to a transform instead of a
 * command would make both surfaces real, and then the adapters have to keep two contracts
 * rather than one. The package's own tests import them by relative path, which is the seam
 * working as intended.
