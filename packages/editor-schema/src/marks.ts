/**
 * The colours text may be given.
 *
 * **Names, never values.** A picker that wrote a literal colour into a document body would
 * hard-code it in the most durable place this product has: a stored document outlives every
 * stylesheet, so the value would be fixed forever, wrong on one of the two grounds from the
 * day it was typed and unfixable without a content migration. A name resolves through the
 * design tokens at render, which is what makes the same document legible on both.
 *
 * **Three, not six.** The token sheet is deliberately mono - one steel accent, no red and no
 * amber (ADR-0011) - so semantic names like `success` and `danger` have no hue to resolve to.
 * Offering them would mean a picker with six entries and three renderings, which is a control
 * that lies: the document would store a distinction the product never honours, permanently, in
 * the place that is hardest to take back. Callouts get away with four tones because a
 * container can vary its border weight; an inline span has no border to vary. Widening this
 * set is an ADR adding a semantic ramp to the tokens, not a class string.
 *
 * A closed set for the same reason `CALLOUT_TONES` is closed, and with the same fallback: a
 * value this build does not know renders as `default` rather than failing to parse. Text in
 * the wrong colour is readable; a document that will not open is not.
 *
 * **The fallback is applied at render, not at parse.** A document arriving from a newer build
 * with a colour this one has never heard of keeps that value in the CRDT and passes it on
 * untouched; only the drawing falls back. Normalising on the way in would mean an older client
 * silently rewriting a newer client's document every time it opened one.
