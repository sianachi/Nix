 * list. `SCHEMA_VERSION` says what this build can read; these two tables say what a given
 * *document* needs, which is the finer-grained question and the one that keeps a document's
 * pin honest.
 *
 * **Why this exists at all.** `content_doc.schema_version` is a promise: "no build older than
 * this is needed to open me." Nothing enforced that promise before - a new build could write a
 * brand-new node into a document still pinned to 1, and the next older client to open it would
 * be told the document was safe and then fail to parse it. The pin was true only by scheduling,
 * which is to say true until the first time it mattered. Walking a merged document against
 * these tables is what makes it true by construction.
 *
 * Kept here rather than in the collaboration service because it is a fact about the schema, and
 * the schema is defined exactly once (`extensions.ts`). A second copy in Node is the drift this
 * package exists to prevent.
