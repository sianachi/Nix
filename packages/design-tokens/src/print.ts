/**
 * The colours an exported document is drawn with.
 *
 * **This package's first JavaScript export, and the reason is a guard rather than a preference.**
 * `scripts/check-raw-design-values.sh` scans `apps/` and `packages/` for raw hex and prunes exactly
 * one directory: this one. A PDF converter writing `'#1d1f20'` trips it; a DOCX converter writing
 * the same colour as `'1D1F20'` - Open XML takes no leading hash - does not. A guard that catches
 * one of two twins is worse than one that catches neither, because it teaches you it is covering
 * you. Declaring the palette here makes both converters exempt *by construction* and satisfies
 * AGENTS.md's "all colours come from packages/design-tokens" literally rather than by waiver.
 *
 * **These are the light ground's values and always will be.** A document printed on paper has one
 * ground; there is no dark-mode PDF. `print.test.ts` asserts every value below appears verbatim in
 * `theme.css`'s light ground, which is the only thing stopping this file becoming a second, stale
 * copy of the palette.
 *
 * **The screen roles that are not literal colours are resolved to the nearest ramp step.**
 * `--color-divider` is a `color-mix()` against the ground, which a PDF or an Open XML fill cannot
 * express - both take a flat colour. The neutral step named below is what that mix lands on over
 * paper, and stating the substitution here is better than each converter inventing its own.
 */

/**
 * The roles a converter draws with.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from `@nix/export`, whose `DocumentConverter` seam names the
 * same shape. Neither package depends on the other - a token sheet that imported an export format's
 * types, or an export format that imported a stylesheet, would both be the wrong direction - and
 * structural typing makes the import unnecessary. What keeps the two honest is that every converter
 * imports both, so a field added on one side and not the other stops compiling where they meet.
