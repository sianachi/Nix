/**
 * The structural shapes this package's vocabulary and compiler traffic in.
 *
 * These mirror `apps/web/src/views/core/container-model.ts`'s `PropertyDefinition`, form types
 * and `View` field for field - same names, same shapes, same optionality - so a value built here
 * is assignable to the web type and a web value is assignable back, without either side importing
 * the other. `apps/web/src/tests/views/structure-spec-contract.test.ts` asserts that mutual
 * assignability at compile time: a renamed or narrowed field on either side fails typecheck there.
 * It is not exact type equality - an optional field added to only one side would still pass - so
 * a field added here still needs a human to notice it belongs on both sides.
 *
 * Deliberately no `readonly` array types (`string[]`, not `readonly string[]`): the web types are
 * `z.infer` results and hold mutable arrays, and a `readonly string[]` here would not be
 * assignable back to that mutable array type, breaking the tie in one direction.
 *
 * This package may depend only on `zod` and `@nix/sheet` (task 0.3 of
 * `docs/plans/pet-structure-consult-plan.md`; see
 * `docs/adr/0050-companion-structure-tools-compile-declarative-specs.md`), so it cannot import the
 * web's Zod-parsed contract types directly - `container-model.ts` is tied to `@nix/api-client`,
 * and `@nix/structure-spec` must stay outside that dependency graph. This boundary is not checked
 * by the compiler; `package-boundary.test.ts` reads this package's own `package.json` and fails
 * if a runtime dependency other than `zod` or `@nix/sheet` is ever added.
