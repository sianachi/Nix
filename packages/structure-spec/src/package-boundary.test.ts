/**
 * `@nix/structure-spec` exists to be importable from anywhere - the web, `@nix/companion`, and
 * eventually nixctl and the Go worker's catalog generator - without pulling in a browser, React,
 * or `@nix/api-client`. `types.ts`'s header comment states that constraint, but nothing in the
 * type system enforces it: a later wave could add a dependency and nothing would fail until
 * someone noticed a cycle or a bundle that grew. This test is that check, reading the package's
 * own manifest rather than trusting the comment to stay true.
