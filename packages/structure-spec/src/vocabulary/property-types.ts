 * What each property type is called when a person reads it.
 *
 * **One table, because the wire name is not a word anybody should be shown.** The contract stores
 * types as `multi_select`, `timestamp` and `image`; the interface calls them "Multi-select (any of
 * a list)", "Date and time" and "Picture". Three panels had grown their own answer to that - the
 * schema editor had this table, and the board and the gallery interpolated the raw token into a
 * sentence - so a person could be told their cover property "is now a multi_select field", with the
 * underscore, about a type they had chosen from a list that never used that word.
 *
 * The gallery makes the gap unmissable rather than merely untidy: it is the first type whose label
 * and wire name are different words entirely, so a hint saying "there is no image property yet"
 * sends somebody looking for "Image" in a list that only offers "Picture".
