/**
 * The shipped smart-list starting points - a registry in the `templates.ts` shape (ADR-0014):
 * presets this build offers, not user-saved artifacts. Applying one creates an item of type
 * `query` and stores a single query view on it; from there it is an ordinary item whose filters
 * are edited like any view configuration.
 *
 * **The property keys are reserved, not conventions.** Goal 3.1 (ADR-0042) ships task semantics
 * as first-class property types whose key always equals the type's stored name: the due date is
 * always keyed `due_date`, completion is always `completion`. That is exactly what lets a
 * cross-workspace smart list compile one statement over every readable workspace - there is one
 * key to name, not each workspace's own convention. A workspace whose schema does not yet carry
 * the matching task type edits the filters after applying; the preset is a starting point, not a
 * schema.
 *
 * **Assigned to me names the literal token `me`, never a resolved identifier.** Goal 3.5 adds
 * `assignee`, a principal-typed property; the server resolves `me` to the calling principal when
 * the query runs. Resolving it client-side and saving a concrete identifier instead would make a
 * saved smart list mean "assigned to whoever saved it" for every person who later opens it - a
 * different feature, and a bug, not a convenience.
 *
 * `applySmartList` (which needs a `NixClient` to store the view) stays in
 * `apps/web/src/views/query/smart-lists.ts`, which re-exports everything here and adds it.
