/**
 * Walking a document body, once, for every format that has to draw one.
 *
 * **This shares the dispatcher, not the target model.** pdfmake wants a recursive content tree;
 * Open XML wants a flat run of paragraphs where nesting is a numbering-level reference. An emitter
 * abstraction over both would be a lowest common denominator each mapper fights, and it would make
 * a loss one format has and the other does not - columns, which OOXML cannot express inline -
 * impossible to state. What is genuinely common is *exhaustiveness* and the vocabulary for what
 * could not be carried, and that is all this file holds.
 *
 * **The handler map is a mapped type, so a missing node is a compile error.** That, plus the test
 * asserting {@link PROSE_NODES} equals the schema's own node set, is what makes a new block
 * impossible to ship unmapped: adding one to `@nix/editor-schema` fails a test here, and fixing
 * that test then fails to compile in every converter until each says what it does with it.
 *
 * **The body is read as plain JSON rather than parsed through `nixSchema` or a Zod schema, which is
 * a deliberate exception to the parse-at-every-boundary rule.** An archive outlives the build that
 * wrote it, so a body may hold a node this build has never heard of; a schema that validates the
 * whole document would refuse it entirely, and refusing a whole document over one unknown block is
 * a worse answer than drawing the rest and saying what was skipped. The rule the boundary keeps
 * instead is that **nothing is dropped silently** - every value this file declines to render leaves
 * a `LossKind` behind. See ADR-0037.
