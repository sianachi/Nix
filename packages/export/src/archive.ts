/**
 * Writes a `.nix` archive as a stream of chunks.
 *
 * **The manifest is written first**, before any payload, so a reader has the tree before it has the
 * bodies. That is what lets a large archive be read without being held: a zip's central directory
 * is at the end, so an archive whose structure lived only there could not be streamed at all.
 *
 * **The caller supplies the manifest up front and the bundles lazily.** Enumerating the tree is
 * metadata-only and cheap; fetching bodies is neither. Separating them is what keeps this writer's
 * memory bounded by one item rather than by the size of the export - and it is why ADR-0017 puts
 * parentage and sibling order on the manifest spine rather than nesting children inside parents.
 *
 * **A failure part-way through truncates rather than completes.** Once the first byte is out there
 * is no status code left to change, so a bundle that cannot be produced ends the stream without the
 * central directory. The result does not open, which is the honest outcome - an archive that opens
 * and is quietly missing items would be a lie about the one property this format sells.
