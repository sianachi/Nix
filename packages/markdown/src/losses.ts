/**
 * What a Markdown conversion could not carry across, and the two result shapes the public
 * functions return.
 *
 * **Markdown has a smaller vocabulary than the document schema, so a faithful conversion has to
 * say what it dropped rather than drop it quietly.** The `@nix/export` visitor already owns a
 * closed {@link LossKind} set for the archive formats; this package keeps its own open-string set
 * instead, because the Markdown mapping loses different things (a column layout, an inline colour)
 * than a PDF does, and folding both into one closed enum would make each converter carry the
 * other's kinds. The two are bridged in one place - `documentToMarkdown` folds the visitor's own
 * structural losses (an unknown block from a newer build, a malformed node) into this collector by
 * their kind string - so the caller still sees a single list.
 *
 * Kinds are deduped: a document that drops forty comment marks reports `comment-dropped` once, the
 * same posture `@nix/export`'s report takes, because a reader wants "comments were dropped", not
 * forty identical sentences.
