/**
 * Telemetry hooks for the API client.
 *
 * The client never swallows a failure. Everything that would otherwise be a
 * silent fallback - a response that does not match its schema, a background
 * revalidation that failed, a request that came back as a problem document -
 * is reported here so the host application can forward it to its observability
 * pipeline. All hooks are optional and are invoked defensively: a throwing
 * hook must never break a request, so callers wrap invocations in `report`.
 *
 * Hooks are synchronous and must stay cheap. Anything expensive belongs on the
 * host side of the boundary (queue it, batch it, sample it).
