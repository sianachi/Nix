/**
 * An item: the workspace's universal object — a note, task, folder, board or file.
 *
 * Two rules make this file work, and they are the pattern every resource schema copies. The schema
 * is the source of truth and the TypeScript type is always `z.infer` of it, never a hand-written
 * interface that can drift. And the `satisfies` line at the bottom ties it to the generated
 * contract, so a field the backend renames fails this package's build instead of failing at
 * runtime in front of a user.
 *
 * This schema was previously a guess made before the contract existed, and it was wrong in three
 * ways worth remembering: it called the field `kind` and typed it as an enum, and it was missing
 * `seq`, `lifecycleState` and `createdAt`. The enum was the interesting mistake — item kinds are
 * added as a feature, so an enum would have broken every client each time one landed.
 *
 * The `satisfies` line has since earned itself once more: `properties` arrived with property
 * schemas and this file stopped compiling, which is exactly where that should be found.

 * schema and offer views, whatever its kind. The set is open by design and a client is expected to
