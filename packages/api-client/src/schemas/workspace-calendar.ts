/**
 * Every calendar in a workspace, collated into one window of dated entries.
 *
 * Three properties of the payload are worth knowing before writing a view against it, because all
 * three are guarantees rather than accidents.
 *
 * **A date is a date wherever it was set.** Which property carries an item's date is decided by the
 * container that holds it, so entries in one response may have been placed by differently named
 * properties. Each entry carries the key it was placed by and the container that decided it, which
 * is what lets a view show them together without claiming one of them was wrong.
 *
 * **Values are not normalised.** A `date` is a day and a `timestamp` is a moment in a named zone,
 * and only the reader's own zone decides which day a moment falls on. The server windows coarsely
 * by the day the value is written with; the client places precisely. An entry near a window edge
 * can therefore belong to a different day for the reader than for the window, which is correct
 * rather than a rounding error.
 *
 * **The response is bounded, and it says so twice, for two different reasons.** `entriesTruncated`
 * means the window holds more concrete entries than came back. `seriesTruncated` means more
 * repeating series exist than this read considered, or than there was room left to expand after
 * concrete entries were read — a different fact, since a workspace can hold more series than this
 * response even names. `unplaceable` names containers that offer a calendar and could place
 * nothing, and repeating items whose series could not be drawn on this calendar — that list is
 * never truncated, because it is the part of the answer that explains what is missing. A truncated
 * list looks short and announces itself; a truncated calendar looks like a calendar, so a view that
 * renders this must say so.
 *
 * **A generated entry is not a stored one.** An entry produced by a recurrence rule rather than
 * read from storage carries `generated: true` and its own `completed` state; a view must not offer
 * to edit or delete it as if it were a row in storage, since there is no row behind it, only the
 * series that produced it. A stored entry's `completed` is always null — it has no completion state
 * of its own to report.
