/**
 * A recurrence rule on an item, and the two writes that replace, clear, and complete it.

 * The wire shape is intentionally thin: a rule is a frequency, an interval, an optional weekday
 * set, an optional end date, and the completion state Core has recorded against it. The closed set
 * of frequencies and weekdays is validated here so a typo fails at the CLI prompt rather than as an
 * opaque 422 from Core; which combinations Core actually accepts for a given frequency (weekdays
 * only make sense on `weekly`, for instance) stays Core's own judgment, the same way `views set`
 * leaves a view's shape to its 422.
