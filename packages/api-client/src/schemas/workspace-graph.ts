/**
 * A workspace drawn as a graph: a node per item the caller may read, and a link per reference edge
 * between two of those nodes.
 *
 * Two properties of the payload are worth knowing before writing a view against it, because both
 * are guarantees rather than accidents. A link's two ends are always present in `nodes`, and a
 * node's `parentId` is null unless that parent is in `nodes` too — so nothing here points at
 * something the response does not carry, and a renderer never has to decide what to draw for a
 * dangling reference. And the response is bounded: when `nodesTruncated` or `linksTruncated` is
 * true, what came back is a real part of the workspace rather than all of it.
 *
 * That second one is the reason this schema does not treat the flags as optional detail. A
 * truncated list looks short and a truncated graph looks like a graph — a reader would conclude two
 * clusters are unconnected, which is a wrong answer rather than a missing one. A view that renders
 * this must say so.
