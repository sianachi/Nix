/**
 * What an ad-hoc workspace query or aggregate answered (`POST /workspaces/{id}/query` and
 * `/query/aggregate`).
 *
 * The same guarantees as a saved query's results: **the rows were permission-filtered inside the
 * statement**, so a truncated answer is a full answer that was cut, never a full answer minus
 * refusals; and **`truncated` is the honest-state field** a view must surface. An aggregate adds a
 * third: **`skipped` counts values that were not numbers** and were left out of the fold rather
 * than counted as zero, so a total that skipped something must say so.
