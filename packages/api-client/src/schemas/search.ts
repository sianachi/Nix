/**
 * Full-text search results, as `GET /api/v1/search` returns them.

 * `truncated` is carried as its own field, never folded into the result list: a cut result set is an
 * honest partial answer, and a caller (the CLI, the MCP server) must be able to say "there are more"
 * rather than present a capped list as complete. Each hit is the identity a caller needs to open the
 * item — its id, its workspace, its body kind and its title — plus its parent and modification time,
 * which a picker uses to rank, and nothing heavier.
