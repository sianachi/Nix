/**
 * The contract types this package publishes, one alias per schema.
 *
 * These exist so a boundary schema that lives outside this package can still be tied to the
 * generated contract with `satisfies z.ZodType<...>`, the way `schemas/item.ts` ties `itemSchema`.
 * The `components` map stays private: exporting it would hand every consumer every schema Core has
 * or will grow, and a schema would become public API of this package the moment `generate` ran,
 * with no review step anywhere in between.
 *
 * So each alias is added by hand, when something outside actually needs it. That is the point of
 * friction where somebody notices that a boundary schema has grown outside the package that owns
 * boundaries - which is usually a sign it should move in, not a sign this list should get longer.
