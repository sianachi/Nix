/**
 * <Text> - the typography primitive. Every string the product renders goes
 * through it, so the pairing - one family, headings told apart by weight - and
 * the type scale exist in exactly one place.
 *
 * Two rules are encoded here rather than left to discipline:
 *
 * 1. Family follows role. Heading variants take `--font-heading` at the
 *    heading weight; everything else takes `--font-body`. A caller cannot
 *    pick a family.
 *
 * 2. Accent text respects contrast. The accent/ground pair is tuned to about
 *    3:1 - enough for chrome and large display type, not for body copy - so
 *    `tone="accent"` resolves to the base accent only on the display-size
 *    headings and to `--color-accent-text` everywhere else. There is no way to
 *    ask for base-accent body copy. `--color-accent-text` is a role, so it
 *    moves with the ground: accent-700 at 5.8:1 on paper, accent-300 at 12.1:1
 *    on ink.
 *
 * Sizes and line heights come from the token sheet's type scale (`--text-2xs`
 * ... `--text-3xl`, ADR-0008): each variant names a step and takes the line
 * height paired with it, and nothing here names a pixel. A body-sized heading
 * (h5, h6) therefore takes a body line height, because the pairing belongs to
 * the step rather than to the role - which is what stops the sheet and this
 * file from drifting into two scales.
 *
 * Tracking comes from the sheet's tracking scale (`--tracking-tight` ...
 * `--tracking-widest`), which arrived after this component did: the earlier
 * note here said the sheet carried no such scale and that one value per
 * variant was not worth inventing one for. It exists now, five named steps
 * pulled from the em values a dozen components had each written by hand, and
 * the three variants that track (h1-h5 tight, h6 wider, kicker widest) name a
 * step like every other axis. There is deliberately no `tracking` prop: a
 * caller who wants a different step wants a different variant, and the one
 * real exception in the product - the login wordmark, set at the h2 step but
 * opened to `tracking-slight` because it is two capitals rather than a
 * sentence - is a wordmark, not typography this primitive should learn.
 */

/**
 * `note` is the one variant added by the adoption sweep rather than by the
 * original scale, and it is worth saying why, because a scale that grows a rung
 * per call site stops being a scale.
 *
 * It is `--text-sm` (12px), the step between `bodySmall` (13px) and `caption`
 * (11px). The sheet has always published it - name, size and its own paired
 * line height - and it was the only published step no variant named, which is
 * the whole reason it kept being written by hand. It is not a size somebody
 * wanted; it is the size the interface already speaks in: `Field`'s hint and
 * error lines set it, and so did roughly twenty places in `apps/web` saying the
 * same thing about a control - a validation message, a "loading this" line, an
 * empty-state sentence sitting where a value would be. That is one role with
 * one step, said in twenty voices.
 *
 * Not `caption`, which is metadata *about* content (a figure's caption, a
 * timestamp beside a row) and reads a step quieter. Not `bodySmall`, which is
 * prose the reader is meant to read at length. A note is neither: it is the
 * interface talking about itself.

 * that appears in place announces itself; `note` marks an aside that is commentary on its
 * surroundings; `presentation` strips implicit semantics from a paragraph that is decoration.
 *
 * Anything outside this set is a sign the thing being built is not text: a `role="button"` on a
 * paragraph is a button, and `role="listitem"` on one belongs to a list this component does not
 * render. Widening the union is one line and one reviewer looking at it, which is the point.

 * that carry `htmlFor`, or announce a group, or are the header cell. Wrapping
 * any of them in a paragraph to reach the type would break the wiring that is
 * the whole reason they exist. So the look is published the way `focusRing` and
 * `blueprintFrame` are published: one string, composed onto whatever element
 * the semantics demand.
 *
 * `text-xs` at `tracking-wider` is the sheet's own pairing for caps at this
 * step (see the tracking scale's note: the smaller the caps, the more air they
 * need back). The colour is part of the look and not a caller's choice - a
