/**
 * <Button> - the action control, in the four shapes the Industry system
 * defines.
 *
 * - `primary`   the one solid accent object on the board. It is the only
 *               filled button, and it keeps the blueprint registration marks.
 * - `secondary` a hairline outlined box on the ground.
 * - `ghost`     type only, no box, for tertiary actions.
 * - `icon`      a square outlined box holding a single glyph.
 *
 * The frame's radius comes from `blueprintFrame`, so a button turns its corner
 * the same way a card does; there is no size or
 * radius prop to soften them. Interaction states come from
 * `primitives/interaction` so hover, pressed, focus and disabled read the same
 * on every control in the library.
 *
 * Contrast, and why `primary` fills with `--color-accent-fill` rather than the
 * base accent: the base accent is tuned to about 3:1 against the ground, and
 * that ceiling is a property of the fill, not of the label - even pure white on
 * `--color-accent` reaches only 4.1:1, under the 4.5:1 AA floor for a body-size
 * label. `--color-accent-fill` is defined as the accent step that clears 4.5:1
 * against `--color-background`, and contrast is symmetric, so the role used as
 * a *fill* under a `--color-background` label clears 4.5:1 by construction - on
 * both grounds, without either colour being named here. It is accent-700 on
 * paper (5.8:1, exactly what this button used to hard-code) and accent-300 on
 * ink (12.1:1).
 *
 * It is a separate role from `--color-accent-text` even though the two start
 * equal, because their hover steps move in opposite directions: text moves
 * towards the ground, a fill has to move away from it. See `interaction.ts`.
 *
 * The button is still the one solid accent object; it just sits at the step the
 * design system already reserves for accent-carrying-text.
 *
 * The frame is drawn by the button element itself rather than by a
 * <Blueprint> wrapper: a wrapping div would put the border and the marks
 * outside the focus target, so the focus ring and the frame would disagree.
 * Both halves still come from the frame primitive - `blueprintFrame` for the
 * hairline square box and `RegistrationMarks` for the corners - so there is
 * exactly one definition of the grammar, not a lookalike.
 *
 * Size comes from the sheet's two scales (ADR-0008): the label is `text-md` and
 * every variant is one `--control-md` tall. That height used to belong to the
 * icon button alone, as a literal, while the boxed variants were whatever their
 * padding and line height happened to add up to - 32.4px, so a button never
 * quite lined up with the icon button beside it. Naming the step fixes the row
 * and moves the icon button by nothing.

 * density moves it. Only horizontal - the vertical measure is the control
 * height, which the base class owns.
