/**
 * <Toast> - a transient notice about something that already happened, with room for one way to
 * undo it.
 *
 * Built for one caller today - a deletion the sidebar used to gate behind `window.confirm()` - but
 * shaped as a general "this happened, here is the one thing you can still do about it" notice
 * rather than wired to deletion specifically, so a second caller (an archive, a bulk move) can
 * reach for it without a rewrite. What it deliberately does not grow into: a position prop or a
 * severity/variant axis - `action` stays the single optional recovery this component knows about,
 * one per notice. It is not itself a queue: each `<Toast>` reports exactly one thing that happened.
 * A caller wanting more than one on screen at once - `app-shell.tsx` allows up to two pending
 * deletions, so a third delete does not erase a second one's undo window - mounts more than one
 * `<Toast>`, each independent, rather than asking this component to grow a list prop.
 *
 * **`role="status"`, not `role="alert"`.** The two differ in urgency, not in whether they get
 * announced: `alert` is for something that demands attention now - a failed save, a validation
 * error - and a screen reader may cut off whatever it is reading to announce one. A completed
 * deletion is not that: it is an advisory the reader can finish their sentence before hearing,
 * which is what `status`'s implicit `aria-live="polite"` gives it. Reaching for `alert` because
 * the notice is *time-limited* would be conflating urgency with expiry - the timeout is handled
 * below, not by raising the announcement's priority. The same holds for a notice reporting that a
 * recovery attempt itself failed (a restore that did not go through, say): it is unwelcome news,
 * but not one that demands the reader's attention be interrupted for it, and there is nothing left
 * to do about it from here but try again some other way - so it stays `status` too rather than this
 * component growing a severity axis to give it `alert` instead.
 *
 * **Why this needed a new primitive instead of `announcer.ts`'s live region.** That region is one
 * `<p aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">` for the whole shell, and it is `sr-only` on purpose
 * - it exists to speak a change that already happened on screen, never to *be* the on-screen
 * change. A toast is the opposite: the message and its Undo button are the visible event, and a
 * button cannot be reached by anyone if the element holding it is `sr-only`. So this renders its
 * own visible `role="status"` region rather than pushing text through `announce()` - doing both
 * would announce the same sentence twice.
 *
 * **Focus, in both directions.** The control that opened a toast of this kind is usually gone by
 * the time it mounts - the deleted row it belonged to - so the browser has already dropped focus
 * to `<body>` before this component's own effects run. Landing focus on the primary action (Undo,
 * or the dismiss control when there is none) recovers it rather than leaving a keyboard user
 * stranded at the top of the document; unlike `<Dialog>`, there is no invoker to send focus back
 * to when this closes, so `returnFocusRef` lets the caller nominate a durable landing spot instead
 * (`app-shell.tsx` points it at the workspace tree's own scroll region). Omitting it is only safe
 * when the caller already has somewhere better in mind - the default is `document.body`, the same
 * place focus would have ended up anyway.
 *
 * **`autoFocus`, for the one caller where that story does not hold.** The mount-focus reasoning
 * above assumes focus has nowhere better to be, which is only true when whatever opened the toast
 * is already gone. A toast pushed later in the same flow - `app-shell.tsx`'s failed-undo notice,
 * which can land seconds after Undo already returned focus to the tree, or after the reader has
 * since clicked into a document and started typing - has no such excuse: the reader is somewhere on
 * purpose, and yanking focus away to announce a failure would be the exact bug already fixed for
 * the primary toast, reproduced one step later. `autoFocus={false}` opts a caller like that out; the
 * mount effect then leaves focus wherever the platform already put it, the same safe-failure
 * reasoning `returnFocusRef` above already uses for a target that turns out to be gone. Defaults to
 * `true`, matching every caller that existed before this prop did.
 *
 * **The return is conditional, unlike `<Dialog>`'s.** `<Dialog>` restores its invoker unconditionally
 * because it is modal - focus is inside it for its entire life, by construction, so "the toast is
 * going away" and "focus is leaving it" are the same event. A toast is not modal: the ordinary path
 * is that the reader ignores it and goes back to whatever they were doing - clicking into a document
 * to keep typing, say - long before the timeout ever fires. Reclaiming focus unconditionally on
 * unmount would rip it out of that document eight seconds later, mid-sentence, and hand it to a
 * `tabIndex={-1}` region nobody asked to go to. So the cleanup below only calls `.focus()` if focus
 * was still inside this toast at the moment it closes - tracked by the same `onFocus`/`onBlur` pair
 * that already knows whether focus is inside for the pause feature, in `hasFocusWithinRef`.
 *
 * **Escape dismisses it, but only while focus is inside it.** Gated on the same `hasFocusWithinRef`
 * the pause feature and the conditional return above both read, rather than firing on every Escape
 * press anywhere in the document: an unconditional listener here would silently outrank every other
 * surface's own documented Escape handling whenever a toast happened to be up, whether or not focus
 * was anywhere near it - the off-canvas drawer's own `window` listener (`sidebar-drawer.tsx`), the
 * spreadsheet grid, the slash menu, search, `workspace-sidebar.tsx`'s `CreateMenu`, all of it - and
 * with two toasts mounted at once, `stopPropagation` does not stop a sibling listener on the same
 * `document` node, so a single Escape press would dismiss both rather than only the one actually
 * being read. Gating on focus fixes both at once: a press with focus elsewhere now correctly falls
 * through to whatever should actually handle it, and of two mounted toasts only the one that
 * currently holds focus will ever act on the keypress, which makes the sibling's non-participation
 * moot without needing a coordination mechanism between instances.
 *
 * **The timeout pauses on hover and on focus-within**, restarting from the full duration once
 * neither is true, rather than counting down through either or resuming from where it left off.
 * Reaching this control at all costs a keyboard user at least one Tab press after the deletion that
 * produced it, and a timer that never stopped for that would punish exactly the person the pause
 * exists for. Eight seconds by default: long enough to notice the toast, move a pointer or a Tab
 * press to it, and decide - Material's own guidance gives an action-bearing snackbar the longer of
 * its two durations for the same reason, and the WCAG timing-adjustable case this most resembles is
 * served by the pause rather than by a fixed multi-hour minimum, which would be a strange promise
 * for something reporting a change already made. A full restart rather than a true resume is the
 * simpler contract to reason about - "however long you stayed away, you get the whole notice
 * again" - and is no less generous to the reader than a partial-time resume would have been.
