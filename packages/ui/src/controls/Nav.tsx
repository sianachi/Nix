/**
 * <Nav> - a list of links, one of which may be the page you are on.
 *
 * Used for the settings area today and for in-page section navigation later, in two orientations:
 * a rail down the side and a row of tabs across the top. The two are the same component because
 * they are the same thing - a set of destinations with one current - and splitting them would let
 * the current-item marking drift apart between them.
 *
 * **The current item is marked with `aria-current="page"`, never with colour alone.** A person who
 * cannot see the accent rule still needs to know where they are, and `aria-current` is the only
 * signal that reaches them. The rule and the accent text are the sighted half of the same fact.
 *
 * **Which item is current is not this component's business.** `currentHref` is compared against
 * each item's `href`, so the answer comes from one place - the router, which is the only thing that
 * knows what the URL matched. A per-item `current` flag would let two items both claim it, and a
 * nav with two current items is a nav that is lying to somebody.
 *
 * The links are real links. A nav whose items are buttons with click handlers cannot be
 * middle-clicked, copied, or opened in a new tab, and browsers rightly refuse to treat it as
 * navigation.

/**
 * What a link needs to be drawn. Handed to `renderLink` so the consumer supplies the routing
 * component without this package learning about routers.
 *
 * `href` rather than `to` because that is what the platform calls it; a react-router consumer
 * renames it in the one line where it renders the link. That rename is exactly why this is a render
 * prop and not an `as` element: react-router's `Link` takes `to`, so swapping the tag alone would
 * hand it an `href` it ignores and produce a link that goes nowhere.
