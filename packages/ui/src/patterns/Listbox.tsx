/**
 * <Listbox> - a filtered list of choices, driven from a text field that keeps the focus.
 *
 * The shape behind three different surfaces: the block inserter opened with `/`, the item picker
 * opened with `[[`, and the command palette. All three are the same object - type into a field,
 * move a highlight with the arrow keys, commit with Enter - and all three had been about to grow
 * their own copy of it.
 *
 * **Focus is never pulled into the list, and that is the whole reason this exists.** The obvious
 * implementation makes each option a `<button>` and lets Tab reach it, which puts a listbox's
 * options in the tab order, breaks type-ahead the moment focus leaves the field, and announces
 * every option as a button. The correct pattern keeps focus on the input and moves
 * `aria-activedescendant` instead, so a screen reader reads the highlighted option while the
 * person is still typing into the field they started in. That is fiddly enough - stable ids per
 * option, a controlled index, an `aria-controls` that has to resolve - that it is worth owning
 * once. The list element itself is still a tab stop of its own - a scrollable region must be
 * reachable by keyboard, and its options deliberately are not - and it answers to the same key
 * model, so landing on it directly loses nothing.
 *
 * **Escape is deliberately not handled here.** Which layer closes is the caller's to decide, and
 * the convention in `apps/web` is that the innermost open thing wins and calls `stopPropagation`.
 * A listbox that swallowed Escape would close the picker inside a dialog and leave the dialog open,
 * or worse, close both.
 */

/**
 * As much of a keyboard event as the key model reads.
 *
 * Structural rather than React's `KeyboardEvent`, because not every caller has one. The reference
 * picker keeps focus in the editor - the query it filters on lives in the document, so a field of
 * its own would swallow the typing - and hands this a DOM event off `editor.view.dom`. Both shapes
 * satisfy it, and neither has to be converted.

        Rendered even when empty, so the input's `aria-controls` always resolves to something. An
        id that points at nothing is worse than an empty list: assistive technology reports the
        relationship as broken rather than as "no results".

        It carries no `hidden`, which it used to: `hidden` is `display: none`, which takes the
        element out of the accessibility tree and so undoes the very thing this comment is about.
        With no options the element has no children and no height, so there was nothing for it to
        hide either.

        `tabIndex` when, and only when, there is something to scroll. Being honest about what it
        buys, because the obvious reading of it is wrong: the keyboard route through this list is
        the arrow keys *from the field*, which move the highlight and let the effect above scroll
        it into view. It is not Tab into the list. Every caller dismisses the popup when the field
        blurs, so tabbing out of the field closes the list before focus could land here - this stop
        is, in practice, unreachable in the product.

        It stays for two reasons. It is what keeps `scrollable-region-focusable` satisfied: the
        wrapper the caller makes scrollable (via `className`) needs focusable content inside it,
        and the options are deliberately not focusable because the highlight travels by
        `aria-activedescendant`. And a caller that does not dismiss on blur gets a working focused
        listbox for free - the same keys, `aria-activedescendant` already in place.

        Conditional because an empty list is neither scrollable nor operable: without the guard, a
        picker showing "no results" would put a nameable, focusable, do-nothing stop in the tab
        order, which is a worse outcome than the rule it was placating.
