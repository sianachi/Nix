/**
 * `a11y.test: 'error'` makes an axe finding fail the story under the Vitest
 * addon, so an inaccessible component cannot merge green. Backgrounds are
 * disabled because the ground is not a decoration a story picks: it is
 * `--color-bg`, set on the body by the Tailwind entry, and the `ground` global
 * below is the only thing that moves it.
 *
 * The token sheet describes two grounds (ADR-0008), and the contrast reasoning
 * recorded across the library was derived against the light one. So the ground
 * is a global with a toolbar switch, and a story that wants the dark one says
 * `globals: { ground: 'dark' }` - which is what puts axe on both grounds.

/**
 * The ground is chosen by writing `data-theme` on the document element, which
 * is the switch the token sheet is built around: `:root[data-theme]` reassigns
 * the semantic roles and outranks `prefers-color-scheme`, so a headless browser
 * reporting a light system preference still renders the dark ground faithfully.
 *
 * It has to be the document element and not a wrapper: the sheet's selector is
 * `:root[data-theme='dark']`, and the page's own background comes from the
 * Tailwind entry's `body` rule, so a nested wrapper would tint the story and
 * leave the page behind it on the other ground - which is exactly the mismatch
 * an axe contrast check would then measure. Every story sets the attribute,
 * light included, so a dark story cannot leak into the one after it.
