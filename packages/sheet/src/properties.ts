/**
 * Formula properties: an expression over one item's own properties.
 *
 * The second surface of the one formula engine. A sheet body addresses cells and this addresses
 * property keys, but the lexer, the parser, the operators, the coercions and the function registry
 * underneath are the same ones - which is what goal 2.1 means by "built on the formula engine that
 * already ships rather than a second one". Only two things are this module's own: the bracketed
 * reference resolves against a property bag instead of a grid, and the dependency graph's nodes are
 * property keys instead of A1 addresses.
 *
 * **The work is split where the facts are.** Parsing an expression and ordering a set of formulas
 * depend on the *schema* and on nothing about any item, so they happen once in
 * {@link planPropertyFormulas} and the result is reused for every item the schema covers.
 * {@link evaluateFormulaPlan} does only what genuinely differs per item: walking the trees against
 * that item's values. Doing both per item measured 10.49 ms for 3,000 items with three formulas
 * each; planned once, the same work is 3.02 ms, and the schema-invariant objects the per-item
 * version allocated - about 90 per item, some 276,000 across that page - are gone with it. On a
 * container of that size the derivation runs twice per property edit, once optimistically and once
 * on the server's answer, so this is a per-write path. Goal 2.4's rule is that evaluation must not
 * turn a list render into a dependency walk, and rebuilding the dependency graph three thousand
 * times is that walk.
 *
 * **Values are never stored.** A formula property is computed wherever it is read, from the values
 * the item carries at that moment, so it cannot go stale and there is nothing to recompute on a
 * write. That is also why nothing here touches I/O, a clock or randomness: the same bag produces
 * the same values everywhere, the property the engine already holds for sheets.
 *
 * **The value domain is the sheet's.** A formula yields a number, text, a boolean, empty, or one of
 * the sheet error values - the same closed set a cell holds, formatted by the same
 * `formatCellValue`. A property type of its own for computed results would be a second value domain
 * to coerce, compare and render.

   * lengths passed the ceiling, every formula in it read `#LIMIT!` - twenty columns averaging 270
   * characters was enough - and Core stored such a schema happily, because it checks each
