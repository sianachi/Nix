/// unit-of-work transaction for up to twenty seconds (the gate runs inside the endpoint, after
/// the unit of work has begun). Two bounds keep that from exhausting the pool: at most two per
/// principal, and at most <see cref="MaxConcurrentPerProcess"/> across every principal, well under
/// the default connection pool of one hundred. Both are per process: with several Core replicas a
/// principal can hold two per replica (recorded in ADR-0051).
