/// <b><see cref="Title"/> is a property, promoted.</b> The item table has no title column - a
/// name is one of the schema-driven properties an item carries, like any other. It is lifted to a
/// first-class field here because every client needs it to render a row and none of them should
/// have to reach into a property bag to find out what a thing is called. The goal that implements
/// items owns that mapping.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><see cref="Type"/> is an open string, not an enumeration.</b> Adding a kind of item should
/// be a feature rather than a breaking change to every generated client, so clients are expected
/// to render an unknown type generically instead of failing to parse it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><see cref="Properties"/> carries the whole bag, title included.</b> The promotion of
/// <see cref="Title"/> to a first-class field is a convenience for the rows every client renders,
/// not a claim that the title is stored separately - it is one property among the others, and a
/// list view showing a "Title" column alongside the rest would find nothing there if the bag hid
/// it. What a client should not do is write through both: renames go through the item's own
/// operation, which is why the property write refuses to redeclare that key.
