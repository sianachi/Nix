/// One context per feature rather than one for the API, and <c>Program</c> chains them all onto
/// the serializer's resolver chain. The generated output is equivalent either way; what changes is
/// that adding a response type touches a file inside one feature instead of a file every feature
/// shares. With several goals in flight at once, a single registration point is a merge conflict
/// on every one of them - and they are the boring kind that get resolved carelessly.
