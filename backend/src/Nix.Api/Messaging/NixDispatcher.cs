/// shape that would infer - <c>SendAsync&lt;TResult&gt;(ICommand&lt;TResult&gt; command)</c> -
/// only knows the command's static type, so it would have to find the handler from
/// <c>command.GetType()</c> through <c>MakeGenericMethod</c>. That is reflection on a request
/// path, which this codebase already refuses for JSON (see <c>Program.cs</c>), and it trips
/// IL2060/IL3050 under warnings-as-errors. Naming the second type argument is what buys a graph
/// the compiler checks end to end.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>This is the seam for anything cross-cutting.</b> Timing, audit, and logging belong in the
/// two methods below, where every command and query passes through one place. That is the whole
/// reason a dispatcher exists rather than endpoints injecting handlers directly - there is no
/// pipeline abstraction to configure, just a method body to add a line to.

/// Resolution goes through <see cref="IServiceProvider"/> rather than through constructor-injected
/// handlers because a request touches one or two handlers out of dozens, and injecting all of them
