/// <b>Why the title lives here rather than in a column.</b> The entity model gives an item no
/// title of its own: a name is one of the schema-driven properties an item carries, like any

/// client needs it to render a row, and this is the mapping that makes the promotion honest.

/// The cost is a small JSON parse per item read, which is fine at a page of fifty and is not
/// where this should stay. The goal that introduces property schemas owns the typed
/// representation, and the moment properties are validated on write it should also own an
/// expression index over the title - ordering a folder by name is a query nobody can serve from a
/// string parse.
/// </para>
