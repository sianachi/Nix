/// <para>
/// <b>Why this exists apart from the route-level check.</b> The unit-of-work middleware refuses a
/// token-authenticated request whose scope does not reach the route it called. That closes every
/// surface Core owns. It does not close the one surface Core answers <i>about</i> rather than
/// <i>for</i>: <c>GetItemAuthorization</c> reports <c>CanWrite</c> to the collaboration service,
/// which then accepts body updates on its own without another call to Core. A read-scoped token
/// reaches that endpoint legitimately - it is a GET - so the report has to carry the ceiling too,
/// or the scope stops at Core's door and the documents behind it are unprotected.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the middleware, once it has admitted a token session, records here what that token may do,
/// and the authorization handler intersects its answer with it. An interactive session never sets
/// this, and its defaults are permissive: a person's ceiling is their permissions, resolved the
/// usual way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Set once per scope, like <see cref="NixSessionContext"/>, and for the same reason: a capability
/// that changed mid-request would let later work assume a ceiling earlier work did not enforce.
