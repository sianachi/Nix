/// The rules are ADR-0007: nearest ancestor wins per key, <c>inherit: false</c> stops the walk

/// <para>
/// <b>Answers are deliberately not memoised, and that is not an oversight.</b> The obvious
/// optimisation - cache per unit of work, since a scope is one request against rows only this
/// transaction could be changing - is wrong, because this transaction is exactly what changes
/// them. Declaring a schema and then reading it back, or moving an item and then validating its
/// properties, both happen inside one request; a cache populated before the write answers the read
/// with the state that no longer holds. The cascade property test caught precisely that, and the
/// consequence was not a stale display but validation against the wrong rules.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The cost is one indexed query per resolution, and resolutions are per container rather than per
/// item: a listing resolves once for the parent, not once per child. If a profile ever shows that
/// is not enough, ADR-0007 §3 names the escape hatch - a materialised resolution behind this same
/// port - which is a design that has to answer the invalidation question properly rather than
/// assume it away.
