/// <b>Two predicates, not one.</b> Every arm carries both <c>workspace_id = @workspace_id</c> (which
/// workspace was asked for) and <c>workspace_id = ANY(@workspace_ids)</c> (which ones may be
/// answered). While visibility is per workspace the second is implied by a membership test the
/// handler has already made; it is still written, because the handler's test is a fact about the
/// request and the predicate is a fact about the rows. When access control entries make visibility
/// per item, the predicate is the line that grows and the handler does not move.

/// TaskSemantics migration added after measurement showed the old shape reading all 10,001 rows
/// of a 10k workspace to find its 30 view-declaring containers (container CTE: 4.432 ms / 473
/// buffers before, 0.708 ms / 4 after). The child join stays on <c>IX_item_parent_id_seq</c>-shaped
/// access and remains proportional to workspace size; a single workspace past ~200k items puts
/// this statement beyond 250 ms, which is the recorded threshold for revisiting it. The figures
/// are the design measurement's; <c>TaskSemanticsPlanEvidenceTests</c> is the standing check and

    /// (<c>2026-03-17T09:00:00+00:00[Europe/London]</c>). Both begin with the same ten characters,

    /// parse the bracketed suffix.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>The ceiling is applied to the entries alone.</b> The unplaceable containers are the part
