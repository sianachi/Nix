/// <para>
/// This is hand-written because the visibility predicate is a closure-table read. The equivalent
/// LINQ anti-join let Postgres start from every non-active candidate in the tenant, making an item
/// open and each collaboration authorization handshake grow with workspace size. The materialized
/// descendant range and lateral point probe keep the work proportional to path depth instead.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The proper-ancestor probe is a left lateral join so a missing stored ancestor fails closed.
/// Its logically redundant <c>LIMIT 1</c> is load-bearing: the alternate key already guarantees
/// at most one row, while the limit prevents the RLS-aware planner from flattening the probe and
/// returning to a tenant-wide lifecycle scan.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Index dependencies: <c>AK_item_tenant_id_id</c> for the subject and each ancestor, plus
/// <c>IX_item_closure_tenant_id_descendant_id</c> (or the closure primary key) for the path. The
/// production command and its parameters are captured and explained by
/// <c>ItemVisibilityPlanEvidenceTests</c> under the runtime role and RLS.
