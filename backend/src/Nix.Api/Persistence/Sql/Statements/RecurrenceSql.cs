/// <b>The anchor is always the item's reserved <c>due_date</c>, and the container's own axis is
/// projected beside it so the caller can refuse to draw a series the calendar is not showing.</b>
/// A series repeats from the day it is due - that is what <c>RecurrenceRule</c> means by an anchor -
/// so anchoring on whatever else a container happened to place by would make "completed the
/// occurrence" and "drew the occurrence" disagree about which day an occurrence is. Where a
/// container's calendar places by something other than <c>due_date</c>, the honest answer is that
/// this calendar cannot show the series, which the caller reports as unplaceable rather than
/// drawing occurrences on an axis nobody asked for.
/// </para>

/// <b>Two predicates, not one</b>, matching <see cref="CalendarSql"/> exactly: the workspace asked
/// for, and the workspaces the caller may read. Same rule, same reason.

/// <b>The window prunes by its end, never by its start.</b> A series anchored a year ago still
/// expands into today - pruning the anchor by <c>@from</c> would be the obvious symmetry with the
/// concrete arm and would silently drop every long-running series, which is the whole feature.
/// Only <c>until</c> prunes from the near side, inclusively: a series ending on the window's first
/// day still has that occurrence. <c>completedThrough</c> prunes nothing at all - a completed
