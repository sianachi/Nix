/// <b>The permission filter is a predicate in the statement, not a pass over the results.</b>
/// Every statement here takes the readable workspaces as a parameter, resolved through
/// <c>IPermissionResolver</c> before the query runs and never sent by the client. Filtering
/// afterwards would be wrong in three separate ways at once: the row count would describe rows the
/// caller may not see, the ranking would be computed against them, and a limit would be spent on
/// them - so a page could come back empty while matches existed. The client never computes
/// permissions and the server never discards rows it should not have read.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two sources, one query.</b> A title lives on <c>item</c>, in <c>properties</c>, and is
/// written by Core. A body's words live in <c>item_search</c> and are written by the collaboration
/// service. They are joined here rather than denormalised into one row, so renaming an item is
/// visible to the next search with no reindex - and a rename is the most common edit an item ever
/// receives.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The dictionary is named, not inherited.</b> <c>english</c> is spelled out in every statement
/// because <c>default_text_search_config</c> is a per-database, per-session setting: a vector built
/// under one configuration and queried under another silently stops matching. The migration that
/// built the column names the same one, and a disagreement is then two visible lines of SQL rather
/// than an invisible dependency on server configuration.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every item listing projects the same six columns first, in the same order</b> - <c>id</c>,
/// <c>workspace_id</c>, <c>type</c>, <c>title</c>, <c>parent_id</c>, <c>last_modified_at</c> -
/// because one reader (<c>ItemDigestColumns</c>) maps them all. A statement's own extra columns
/// (an occurrence count, a shared-source count, a matched phrase) come after.

/// The measured runtime-role plan at the phase corpus uses
