/// <summary>
/// The two candidate reads behind My Day: items that might be tasks, and items carrying habit
/// settings, both in one workspace.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Candidates, not verdicts.</b> Whether an item is a task is decided by its effective schema,
/// which only the handler can resolve; these statements return a superset narrow enough that the
/// ceiling is not spent on finished work. The visibility rules - tenant, workspace, active,
/// non-template, no hidden ancestor, no closed lock above - are the workspace query's own
/// fragments and run before <c>LIMIT</c>, so a ceiling is never consumed by rows the caller
/// cannot see. Binds <c>@tenant_id</c>, <c>@workspace_id</c>, <c>@closed_lock_ids</c> and
/// <c>@candidate_limit</c>; the task statement also binds <c>@today</c> (<c>yyyy-MM-dd</c>) and
/// <c>@me</c> (the acting principal's canonical identifier).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Day comparisons use <c>item.due_day</c>, the generated column, because a bag read is not
/// servable from an index under row security (see <see cref="QuerySql"/>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// shortcut: both statements scan the tenant's items, because the assignee and habit-marker tests
/// are bag reads no index can serve under row security, and the assignee arm's OR defeats
/// <c>ix_item_due_day</c>. Measured as the runtime role on 55,000 items: tasks 23.7 ms / 3,572
/// buffers, habits 19 ms / 52,130 buffers (<c>TaskSemanticsPlanEvidenceTests</c>). Upgrade by
/// adding a leakproof generated column for the habit marker and splitting the assignee arm into
/// its own indexed statement once a tenant outgrows this.
