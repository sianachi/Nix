/// <b>The permission filter is a predicate in the statement</b>, the <see cref="GraphSql"/> /
/// <see cref="CalendarSql"/> rule: the readable workspaces arrive as an array parameter resolved
/// by the handler, never sent by a client, so the LIMIT is spent only on rows the caller may see
/// and an aggregate folds only rows the caller may see. The parent join carries the same
/// readable-workspaces predicate as the row itself: the parent's title is projected, and a
/// cross-workspace parent - impossible today, but held only by caller convention, not by any
/// constraint - must surface as a null container title, never as a name from a workspace the
/// caller cannot read.

/// <b>Day rules over the reserved <c>due_date</c> key compile to <c>item.due_day</c></b> - the
