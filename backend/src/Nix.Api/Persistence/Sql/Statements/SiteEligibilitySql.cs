/// <b>An item is withheld, with everything under it,</b> when it is not active, is a template, is
/// in <c>site_exclusion</c>, holds a lock of its own, or is a post of a dated collection whose date
/// is empty, unparseable or later than <c>@now</c>. The statement walks the tree down from the root
/// by parent pointer and never steps into a withheld item, so everything under one is withheld by
/// construction: a lock covers its subtree, and so does every other reason. Locks are read whoever
/// has them open: a publisher who unlocked a note in their browser does not publish it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A recursive walk rather than a join over the closure table, for cost: it touches the site's
/// pages and the children it prunes, where the closure formulation measured at a scan of the
/// tenant's items and a per-page rescan of the subtree (about a second for 3,000 pages among
/// 60,000 items). The parent pointer is the authoritative edge; the closure is derived from it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The statement runs under the publisher's session, so row-level security bounds it to the
/// tenant, and the handler asks the permission resolver for workspace read access before running
/// it. Locks above the root are the handler's check (<c>IItemLocks.GetStateAsync</c>); the lifecycle
/// of the ancestors above the root is the item tree's (<see cref="ItemVisibilitySql"/>).
