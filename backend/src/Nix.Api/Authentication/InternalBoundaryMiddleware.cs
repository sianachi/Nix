/// The internal surface answers questions the public surface deliberately does not - "may this
/// principal write that item" - so reaching it requires two proofs, layered: this middleware
/// checks a shared secret that only the collaboration service is configured with, and the
/// unit-of-work middleware behind it validates the forwarded user token exactly as it would on a
/// public route. Network policy is the deployment's half of the same boundary; this is the
/// application's half, and it holds even when the network is misconfigured.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every refusal is 404, not 401.</b> A caller without the secret must not learn that an
/// internal surface exists, which routes live on it, or whether a secret is configured at all. For
/// the same reason a deployment with no secret configured refuses everything: an accidentally
/// unset secret must fail closed, and it is logged once at startup rather than per request.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The comparison is constant-time (<see cref="CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals"/>): the
/// secret is long-lived, so a timing oracle on its prefix would be worth an attacker's while.
