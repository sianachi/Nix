/// would surface as a crash-looping pod instead of a failed job. In the cluster this runs as a

/// <b>It runs as <c>nix_migrator</c>, the only role holding <c>BYPASSRLS</c>.</b> The runtime role
/// <c>nix_app</c> cannot create objects in the schema at all, which is checked by the integration
/// suite against the real grants. This runner does not take that on trust either: before touching
/// anything it asks the database whether the role it is connected as can bypass row-level
/// security, and refuses to continue if it cannot. Handing it the application's connection string
/// by mistake fails the job instead of half-migrating under a role that cannot see other tenants'
