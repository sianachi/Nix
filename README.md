Nix ([nixsites](https://github.com/sianachi/nixsites)) is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to
Notion and Obsidian: notes, tasks, habits, journal, files, calendar and finance in one item tree,
for one person or a small group.

It syncs in real time with CRDTs, offers a CLI and an MCP server for AI tools, exports with no
lock-in, and can publish a subtree as a static site.

**[Live demo and docs](https://nix.nixsites.com/).** That site is itself a Nix workspace, published
as a static site.

## What it does

- **One tree, many views.** A body (note, canvas or spreadsheet) is separate from how its children are
  shown: list, board, calendar, timeline, gallery, spreadsheet, chart, habit tracker, finance ledger.
- **Structure you shape yourself.** Property schemas, formulas, rollups, templates and automations,
  plus a companion that builds structure on request, with every plan previewed before it runs.
- **Real-time editing.** CRDT-synced notes with presence, version history and password-locked subtrees.
- **Quiet reminders and sync.** Due tasks and habits arrive as push notifications; Google and Outlook
  calendars sync both ways with a visible log.
- **Safe by construction.** Permissions are enforced by Postgres row-level security, and the web app,
  CLI and MCP server share one authorisation path.
- **No lock-in.** Lossless `.nix` archives, plus PDF, DOCX and Markdown export; Markdown, DOCX, PDF
  and Obsidian import.
- **Scriptable.** `nixctl` is a JSON CLI, and `nixctl mcp` exposes the workspace to AI tools.
- **Publish a subtree** as a static site. The [live demo](https://nix.nixsites.com/) above is one.

The full list is in [docs/features.md](docs/features.md).

**On a phone.** Nix installs as an app, with the same views, a share target and offline copies of notes you have opened.

## How it compares

Nix is for a workspace you run yourself: structured views, and a copy of the data you can take with you.

| | Nix | Notion | Obsidian |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Where it runs | Your machine or server, with Docker or Kubernetes | Notion's hosted service | A folder of Markdown on your devices. Sync is [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) or your own |
| Licence | [MIT](LICENSE) | Proprietary | Proprietary. Free for personal use |
| Shape | One item tree: lists, boards, calendars, sheets, habits, finance and the rest | Pages and databases | Notes, plus a large plugin ecosystem |
| Editing together | Real-time CRDT editing, with presence, for a small group | Real-time collaboration | Files synced between devices |
| Leaving | Lossless `.nix` archives, plus PDF, DOCX and Markdown. An Obsidian vault can be imported | Markdown, HTML and CSV export | The notes are already files |
| Tools | [`nixctl`](docs/features.md) and an MCP server. Publish a subtree as a static site | The Notion API, and Notion Sites | Plugins, and [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) or your own site |

[Anytype](https://anytype.io/) and [AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/) are the other projects people try for
this. Anytype is local-first: the sync protocol is open source and a self-hosted node is
[documented](https://tech.anytype.io/how-to/self-hosting), and the apps are source-available.
AFFiNE is a self-hostable workspace of documents and a whiteboard. Nix keeps tasks, habits, journal,
files, calendar and finance in that same tree, and adds the CLI, the MCP server and static-site
publishing above.

## Run it for real

Docker, with at least 8 GB of memory, is enough to try it. Read
[deploy/install.sh](deploy/install.sh) before you pipe it to a shell.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sianachi/nixsites/main/deploy/install.sh | bash
```

Open <http://nix.localhost> in Chrome or Firefox and sign in with the details it prints.
Safari does not resolve `.localhost` names: add `127.0.0.1 nix.localhost auth.nix.localhost` to
`/etc/hosts` first.

The same line with a public origin is a real install, using the images at `ghcr.io/sianachi/nix`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sianachi/nixsites/main/deploy/install.sh | bash -s -- https://nix.example.org
```

Point `nix.example.org` and `auth.nix.example.org` at the machine and leave ports 80 and 443 free.
Docker with the Compose plugin, `curl`, `openssl` and `jq` must be installed. Give Docker at least
8 GB of memory: the stack runs Postgres, RabbitMQ, an object store, the identity provider and eight
Nix services (API, collaboration, web, and the import, export, plugin, calendar and notification
workers), and a smaller Docker VM thrashes.

The script writes every secret into `~/nix/nix.env` and prints an administrator sign-in. Back that
file up with the Docker volumes (`nix-*`); it cannot be regenerated.

Flags, what the installer starts, upgrades, Kubernetes and image tags are in
[docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Run it locally

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sianachi/nixsites.git && cd nixsites
mise install                       # Node, pnpm, .NET and Go at the pinned versions
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev                           # infrastructure, database, identity, then every service
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> and sign in as `dev@nix.localhost` with `NixDev-Password1!`.
These are local development credentials only.

`pnpm dev` is safe to re-run. Use `bash scripts/dev.sh --help` to start only some services, or
`--skip-stack` when the Docker infrastructure is already up. If a port is taken, see `.env.example`.

Working in JetBrains Rider? `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/rider-run-configs.mts` writes
Run/Debug configurations for each service.
