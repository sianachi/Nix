#   - warns when the running project was created from different Compose files
#     (com.docker.compose.project.config_files), for example an old checkout or override;
#   - lists services whose config hash differs from their running container, which
#     `up` will recreate, and services that `up` would create;
#   - exits 3 when an infrastructure service would be recreated, unless
#     NIX_ALLOW_INFRA_RECREATE=1. NIX_INFRA_SERVICES overrides the protected list.
# Image-only changes under an unchanged tag are not detected; release tags are immutable.
